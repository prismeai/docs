The Prisme.ai API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints that allow you to programmatically interact with all aspects of the Prisme.ai platform. This reference guide will help you understand how to authenticate, make requests, handle errors, and leverage the full capabilities of the API.

## API Overview

The Prisme.ai API is organized around RESTful principles. It accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Key Concepts

<Accordion title="Microservices Architecture">
  The Prisme.ai API is built on a microservices architecture, with each product and major function having its own dedicated service. The api-gateway service handles authentication, routing, and load balancing across these services.
  
  Main services include:
  - **API-Gateway**: Handles authentication, session management, and request routing
  - **Workspaces**: Manages workspaces
  - **Runtime**: Executes automations and processes events
  - **Events**: Handles event management
  - **Console**: Console for the Prisme.ai platform
  - **Pages**: Renders end-user pages within workspaces 

</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Events System">
  Prisme.ai uses an event-driven architecture for many operations. The API allows you to:
  - Subscribe to events via webhooks
  - Emit events to trigger automations
  - Process events in real-time
  
  This event system enables complex workflows and integrations between Prisme.ai and external systems.
</Accordion>

## Making Your First Request

Here's a simple example of making an API request to check the system status:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.studio.prisme.ai/v2/status" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

And a more complex example that requires authentication:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.studio.prisme.ai/v2/workspaces" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with a valid access token. See the [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) page for details on obtaining tokens.
</Warning>

## API Products

The Prisme.ai API is organized into several product areas, each with its own set of endpoints:

The API Explorer allows you to:

- Browse available endpoints
- Make test requests with your authentication
- View request and response details
- Generate code snippets in various languages

Access the API Explorer at `https://api.studio.prisme.ai/explorer` or navigate to the API Reference tab in your Prisme.ai dashboard.

      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
    For detailed information on these authentication methods, try the [Playground](/playground) .
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Authorization Model">
    Prisme.ai implements a flexible permission system:

    <Accordion title="Defining Roles">
      The RBAC system consists of several key elements:

      - **Roles**: Sets of permissions that can be assigned to users
      - **Subjects**: Resources that can be acted upon (pages, files, events, etc.)
      - **Actions**: Operations that can be performed on subjects (read, create, update, etc.)
      - **Rules**: Define which roles can perform which actions on which subjects
      - **Conditions**: Optional criteria that further restrict when rules apply
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Defining Roles">
      ```
      authorizations:
        roles:
          editor: {}  # Built-in role
          
          # Custom role for regular users
          user:
            auth:
              prismeai: {}  # Automatically assigned to all Prisme.ai users
              
          # Role for API access
          workspace:
            auth:
              apiKey: {}  # Can be used with API keys
      ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Creating Rules">
      Define what each role can do with specific rules:

      ```
      rules:
        # Allow editors to read and update workspaces
        - role: editor
          action:
            - read
            - get_usage
            - aggregate_search
            - update
          subject: workspaces
          
        # Give editors full control over files
        - role: editor
          action: manage  # Shorthand for all permissions
          subject: files
      
      ```

      Each rule must include at least:

      - **action**: What can be done (a single action or list)
      - **subject**: What it can be done to (a single subject or list)

      Rules can optionally specify:

      - **role**: Which role this applies to (if omitted, applies to everyone)
      - **conditions**: Restrict the rule to specific cases
      - **inverted**: Set to `true` to make this a deny rule instead of allow
      - **reason**: Documentation string for the rule
    </Accordion>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Network Security

<Steps>
  <Step title="TLS Encryption">
    All API communications should use TLS encryption (HTTPS):

    - Prisme.ai API endpoints only accept HTTPS connections
    - Self-hosted instances should be configured with valid TLS certificates
    - Minimum TLS version 1.2 is recommended
    - Client applications should validate server certificates

    <Warning>
      Never send sensitive data over unencrypted connections. Always verify you're using `https://` URLs for API calls.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Microservices Architecture">
    Prisme.ai uses a secure microservices architecture:

    - The api-gateway is the only publicly exposed service
    - Backend microservices are in a private network
    - Internal services trust the `x-prismeai-user-id` header from the api-gateway
    - Service-to-service communication uses internal authentication
  </Step>
  <Step title="IP Restrictions">
    For self-hosted deployments, consider implementing IP restrictions:

    - Limit API access to specific IP ranges
    - Use VPNs or private networks for sensitive operations
    - Configure firewalls to restrict access to the api-gateway
    - Implement network policies in Kubernetes deployments

    ```yaml
    # Example Kubernetes Network Policy
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: NetworkPolicy
    metadata:
      name: api-gateway-policy
      namespace: prisme-system
    spec:
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: api-gateway
      ingress:
      - from:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 10.0.0.0/24
        ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 443
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data Security

  <Card title="Data Encryption" icon="lock">
    - All data in transit is encrypted using TLS
    - Sensitive data at rest is encrypted
    - Encryption keys are rotated regularly
    - JWT signing keys are automatically rotated
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secret Management" icon="key">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## JWT Security

<Accordion title="JWT Signing and Rotation">
  The api-gateway signs JWTs using JSON Web Keys (JWKs) that are automatically rotated:

  - JWKs are stored in the api-gateway database
  - Keys are rotated based on the `JWKS_ROTATION_DAYS` setting (default: 30 days)
  - When a JWK is rotated, it remains available for verifying existing JWTs
  - Rotated JWKs are removed after `ACCESS_TOKENS_MAX_AGE` (default: 30 days)
  - Key rotation happens during api-gateway startup

  <Warning>
    If a signing JWT has leaked, it must be manually deleted from the database before restarting the api-gateway and runtime services.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="JWT Configuration">
  Environment variables for JWT configuration:

  | Variable                | Description                    | Default Value     |
  | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------- |
  | `JWKS_ROTATION_DAYS`    | Rotation period in days        | 30                |
  | `JWKS_KTY`              | JWK Algorithm family           | RSA               |
  | `JWKS_ALG`              | JWK signature algorithm        | RS256             |
  | `JWKS_SIZE`             | JWK size                       | 2048              |
  | `ACCESS_TOKENS_MAX_AGE` | JWT expiration time in seconds | 2592000 (30 days) |

  Public keys are available at `https://api.studio.prisme.ai/oidc/jwks` for JWT verification.
</Accordion>

## Security Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Secure Token Handling">
    Handle authentication tokens securely:

    - Store tokens in secure HTTP-only cookies or secure storage
    - Never expose tokens in URLs or client-side code
    - Implement token refresh mechanisms
    - Set appropriate token expiration times
    - Revoke tokens when no longer needed

    <Info>
      For web applications, consider using the authorization code flow with PKCE for enhanced security.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Least Privilege">
    Follow the principle of least privilege:

    - Use API keys with minimal required permissions
    - Create role-specific tokens for different operations
    - Regularly audit and revoke unused access
    - Use workspace-scoped tokens instead of global ones

    ```javascript
    // Example of creating a minimally privileged API key
    const response = await fetch('https://api.studio.prisme.ai/v2/workspaces/ws-123/apiKeys', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${userToken}`
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        name: 'Read-only Document Access',
        permissions: [
          {type: 'workspace', id: 'ws-123', action: 'read'},
          {type: 'document', id: '*', action: 'read'}
        ],
        expiresIn: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 // 7 days
      })
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Input Validation">
    Always validate input data:

    - Validate data types and formats
    - Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
    - Use schema validation for request bodies
    - Implement proper error handling for invalid inputs

    ```javascript
    // Example of input validation
    function validateWorkspaceId(workspaceId) {
      // Check for correct format (example: ws-123456)
      if (!/^ws-[a-zA-Z0-9]{6,}$/.test(workspaceId)) {
        throw new Error('Invalid workspace ID format');
      }
      return workspaceId;
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Secure Automation Development">
    When developing automations and integrations:

    - Avoid storing sensitive data in automation code
    - Use workspace secrets for credentials and tokens
    - Implement proper error handling and logging
    - Validate outputs from untrusted sources
    - Limit HTTP request capabilities to necessary endpoints

    ```yaml
    # Example of using workspace secrets in automation
    do:
      - fetch:
          method: POST
          url: ${secrets.API_ENDPOINT}
          headers:
            Authorization: Bearer ${secrets.API_TOKEN}
          body:
            data: ${input.data}
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Regular Security Review">
    Implement a regular security review process:

    - Audit API keys and access tokens
    - Review user permissions and roles
    - Check for unused integrations
    - Monitor for suspicious activity
    - Update client libraries and dependencies
  </Step>
</Steps>

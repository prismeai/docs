The Prisme.ai API uses a robust authentication system to secure access to resources. This guide explains how authentication works and how to implement it in your API requests.

## Authentication Methods

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JWT Authentication">
    JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are the primary authentication method for web clients and interactive sessions.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Obtain a JWT">
        JWTs are issued in two scenarios:

        1. **OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication**: After authenticating with the OIDC server (the api-gateway), clients receive an authorization code that can be exchanged for a JWT. Find your current JWT in the `access-token` cookie sent to the `https://api.studio.prisme.ai/v2/me` API after opening any Prisme.ai page  
        2. **Anonymous authentication**: The `/v2/login/anonymous` endpoint initiates unauthenticated sessions and returns a JWT.

        ```bash
        # Example of anonymous login
        curl -X POST "https://api.studio.prisme.ai/v2/login/anonymous" \
             -H "Content-Type: application/json"
        ```

        Response contains a JWT:

        ```json
        {
          "userId": "anon-123456",
          "sessionId": "session-789012",
          "token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6ImtleS0xIn0..."
        }
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Use the JWT">
        Include the JWT in the Authorization header for API requests:

        ```bash
        curl -X GET "https://api.studio.prisme.ai/v2/workspaces" \
             -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
             -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6ImtleS0xIn0..."
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    <Warning>
      JWTs have an expiration time defined by the `ACCESS_TOKENS_MAX_AGE` setting (default is 30 days). Your application should handle token refreshing or re-authentication when tokens expire.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Access Tokens">
    Access tokens are opaque tokens generated for longer-term programmatic access. They are ideal for scripts, integrations, and backend applications.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Generate an Access Token">
        Authenticated users can generate access tokens using the `/v2/user/accessTokens` endpoint:

        ```bash
        curl -X POST "https://api.studio.prisme.ai/v2/user/accessTokens" \
             -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
             -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT" \
             -d '{
                   "name": "My Integration Token",
                   "expiresAt": 2025-04-28T10:13:21.719Z
                 }'
        ```

        The response includes the access token:

        ```json
        {
          "name": "My Integration Token",
          "expiresAt": "2023-12-31T23:59:59Z",
          "userId": "user id",
          "token": "at:1234abcd5678efgh",
          "_id": "token id"
        }
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Use the Access Token">
        Include the access token in the Authorization header the same way as JWTs:

        ```bash
        curl -X GET "https://api.studio.prisme.ai/v2/workspaces" \
             -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
             -H "Authorization: Bearer at:1234abcd5678efgh"
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    <Warning>
      Access tokens cannot be recovered if lost. Store them securely and never expose them in client-side code.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API Keys">
    API keys are scoped to specific workspaces and provide granular permission control for integrations.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an API Key">
        Workspace administrators can create API keys with specific permissions:

        ```bash
          curl --location 'https://api.studio.prisme.ai/v2/workspaces/<WORKSPACE_ID>/security/apiKeys' \
          --header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT>' \
          --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          --data '{
              "name": "Your ApiKey name",
              "rules": [
                  {
                      "action": "read",
                      "subject": "workspaces"
                  },                
                  {
                      "action": "create",
                      "subject": "files"
                  }
              ]
          }'
        ```

        The response includes the API key:

        ```json
          {
              "apiKey": "<apikey>",
              "name": "Your ApiKey name",
              "rules": [
                  {
                      "action": [
                          "read"
                      ],
                      "subject": "workspaces",
                      "conditions": {
                          "id": "<WORKSPACE_ID>"
                      }
                  },                
                  {
                      "action": [
                          "create"
                      ],
                      "subject": "files",
                      "conditions": {
                          "workspaceId": "<WORKSPACE_ID>"
                      }
                  }
              ],
              "subjectId": "<WORKSPACE_ID>",
              "subjectType": "workspaces"
          }
        ```

        See [RBAC for more advanced rules](/products/ai-builder/rbac)  
      </Step>
      <Step title="Use the API Key">
        Include the API key in the x-prismeai-api-key header:

        ```bash
        curl -X GET "https://api.studio.prisme.ai/v2/workspaces/{workspaceId}" \
             -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
             -H "x-prismeai-api-key: <apikey>"
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    <Info>
      API keys follow the principle of least privilege. They only have the permissions explicitly granted during creation.
    </Info>

## JWT Token Details

<Accordion title="JWT Structure and Signing">
  JWTs issued by Prisme.ai are signed tokens with the following characteristics:

  - **Algorithm**: Defined by `JWKS_ALG` (default: RS256)
  - **Key Type**: Defined by `JWKS_KTY` (default: RSA)
  - **Key Size**: Defined by `JWKS_SIZE` (default: 2048 bits)

  The JWT contains claims about the authenticated user, session, and permissions.

  Example decoded JWT payload:

  ```json
    {
      "prismeaiSessionId": "session id",
      "jti": "...",
      "sub": "user id",
      "iat": 1744705420,
      "exp": 1747297420,
      "scope": "events:write events:read webhooks pages:read files:write files:read",
      "client_id": "prismeai-studio-client",
      "iss": "...",
      "aud": "..."
    }
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="JWT Key Rotation">
  The api-gateway automatically handles JWT key rotation:

  1. JWTs are signed using a JSON Web Key (JWK) that is stored in the api-gateway database
  2. JWKs are automatically rotated according to `JWKS_ROTATION_DAYS` (default: 30 days)
  3. When a JWK is rotated, it remains available for verification of existing JWTs
  4. Rotated JWKs are removed after `ACCESS_TOKENS_MAX_AGE` (default: 30 days) once all their signed JWTs should have expired
  5. Events (`gateway.jwks.updated` and `runtime.jwks.updated`) synchronize all api-gateway and runtime instances when JWKs are rotated or removed

  <Warning>
    If a signing JWK is compromised, it must be manually deleted from the database before restarting both api-gateway and runtime services.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Public Keys">
  Public keys for verifying JWTs are available at:

  ```
  https://api.studio.prisme.ai/oidc/jwks
  ```

  This endpoint returns the public keys in JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) format, which can be used to verify token signatures.
</Accordion>

## Authentication Flow

1. **Client Authentication**: The client authenticates via OIDC or anonymous login to obtain a JWT
2. **API Gateway Validation**: Requests are sent to the api-gateway with the JWT or access token
3. **Header Transformation**: The api-gateway validates the token and adds an `x-prismeai-user-id` header
4. **Internal Routing**: The request is forwarded to the appropriate microservice with the user context
5. **Authorization Check**: The target microservice checks if the authenticated user has the required permissions

<Warning>
  Backend microservices rely on the `x-prismeai-user-id` header for identification. This header should not be directly set in client requests, as it will be overwritten by the api-gateway.
</Warning>

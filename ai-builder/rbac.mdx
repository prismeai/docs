# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in AI Builder enables you to manage who can access, modify, and deploy your AI applications. Implementing proper access control is essential for security, compliance, and effective team collaboration.

## RBAC Fundamentals

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Core Concepts">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/rbac-concepts.png" alt="RBAC Core Concepts" />
    </Frame>
    
    Essential elements of the RBAC system:
    
    - **Users**: Individual accounts with unique identities
    - **Roles**: Collections of permissions assigned to users
    - **Permissions**: Specific actions that can be performed
    - **Resources**: Objects that actions can be performed upon
    - **Policies**: Rules that determine access rights
    
    These components work together to create a comprehensive access control system.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="RBAC Architecture">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/rbac-architecture.png" alt="RBAC Architecture" />
    </Frame>
    
    How the RBAC system is structured:
    
    - **Multi-Level Control**: Workspace, resource, and operation-level permissions
    - **Inheritance Model**: Permissions flow from broader to more specific contexts
    - **Policy Enforcement**: Centralized validation of access requests
    - **Authentication Integration**: Works with SSO and identity providers
    - **Audit System**: Tracks all permission changes and access attempts
    
    The architecture provides flexible but secure access management.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Access Model">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/access-model.png" alt="Access Model" />
    </Frame>
    
    The framework for determining access rights:
    
    - **Explicit Grants**: Directly assigned permissions
    - **Role Membership**: Permissions inherited from roles
    - **Resource Hierarchy**: Permissions that apply to nested resources
    - **Default Denials**: Access is denied unless explicitly granted
    - **Conflict Resolution**: How contradictory permissions are resolved
    
    This model defines how the system determines whether to allow an action.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Workspace Access Control

Manage access at the workspace level:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Workspace Roles">
    Define who can access and manage the workspace:
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/workspace-roles.png" alt="Workspace Roles" />
    </Frame>
    
    Default workspace roles include:
    - **Owner**: Complete control over the workspace
    - **Editor**: Can modify workspace content but not workspace settings
    - **Viewer**: Can view workspace content but not modify it
    - **Custom Roles**: Tailored permission sets for specific needs
    
    Workspace roles control the broadest level of access.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="User Assignment">
    Add users to the workspace with specific roles:
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/user-assignment.png" alt="User Assignment" />
    </Frame>
    
    User management options:
    1. Navigate to workspace settings
    2. Access the "Access Roles" section
    3. Add users by email address
    4. Assign appropriate roles
    5. Set optional time-limited access
    
    User assignments determine who can access the workspace and what they can do.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Custom Role Definition">
    Create specialized roles for specific needs:
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/custom-role-definition.png" alt="Custom Role Definition" />
    </Frame>
    
    Custom role creation process:
    1. Go to workspace settings
    2. Select "Manage Roles" under advanced settings
    3. Create a new role with a descriptive name
    4. Select permissions to include
    5. Save the custom role configuration
    
    Custom roles enable fine-grained access control tailored to your organization.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access Policies">
    Define rules that govern workspace access:
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/access-policies.png" alt="Access Policies" />
    </Frame>
    
    Policy configuration options:
    - **IP Restrictions**: Limit access to specific networks
    - **Time-Based Access**: Restrict access to certain hours
    - **Conditional Access**: Rules based on user attributes
    - **Multi-Factor Requirements**: Enhanced security for sensitive actions
    - **Session Controls**: Manage login duration and conditions
    
    Access policies add additional security layers beyond role assignments.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Implementing RBAC with AI Knowledge

<Warning>
  Implementing proper RBAC is especially important when working with AI Knowledge agents that may access sensitive organizational information.
</Warning>

Control access to knowledge bases and agents:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Knowledge Base Access Control">
    Manage who can view and use organizational knowledge:
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/knowledge-base-access.png" alt="Knowledge Base Access Control" />
    </Frame>
    
    Key considerations:
    - Define who can view different knowledge collections
    - Control who can contribute to knowledge bases
    - Limit sensitive information to appropriate roles
    - Track access to restricted knowledge
    - Ensure consistent permissions across similar content
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Agent Deployment Permissions">
    Control who can create and deploy AI agents:
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/agent-deployment.png" alt="Agent Deployment Permissions" />
    </Frame>
    
    Important controls:
    - Limit agent creation to authorized roles
    - Control which knowledge bases agents can access
    - Manage who can test and validate agents
    - Restrict production deployment permissions
    - Define who can monitor agent usage
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Data Access Boundaries">
    Create boundaries around sensitive information:
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/data-boundaries.png" alt="Data Access Boundaries" />
    </Frame>
    
    Implementation strategies:
    - Create knowledge base categories with different access levels
    - Implement data classification for documents
    - Use metadata-based access control
    - Restrict access based on document sensitivity
    - Create data handling policies for AI responses
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Usage Controls">
    Manage how AI agents are used:
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/usage-controls.png" alt="Usage Controls" />
    </Frame>
    
    Control mechanisms:
    - Set usage quotas for different user roles
    - Implement rate limiting for API access
    - Create approval workflows for certain agent actions
    - Monitor and audit agent interactions
    - Define allowed use cases per role
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting Common RBAC Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Access Denied Unexpectedly">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/access-denied.png" alt="Access Denied Unexpectedly" />
    </Frame>
    
    When users encounter unexpected permission barriers:
    
    **Common Causes**:
    - Role not correctly assigned
    - Resource has explicit denial
    - Inherited permissions creating conflicts
    - Missing intermediate permission (like folder access)
    - Temporary outage in identity system
    
    **Resolution Steps**:
    1. Verify user's assigned roles
    2. Check for explicit deny rules that might override allows
    3. Examine resource inheritance chain
    4. Review permission logs for the specific request
    5. Test with a user who has broader permissions to isolate the issue
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Too Many Permissions">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/too-many-permissions.png" alt="Too Many Permissions" />
    </Frame>
    
    When users have more access than appropriate:
    
    **Common Causes**:
    - Overly broad role definitions
    - Unnecessary role assignments
    - Improper role inheritance
    - Role explosion (too many custom roles)
    - Emergency access not revoked
    
    **Resolution Steps**:
    1. Audit user's complete permission set
    2. Review role definitions for excessive privileges
    3. Check for temporary roles that should be removed
    4. Implement more granular role definitions
    5. Add conditional access where appropriate
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Role Management Complexity">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/role-complexity.png" alt="Role Management Complexity" />
    </Frame>
    
    When RBAC becomes too complex to manage effectively:
    
    **Common Causes**:
    - Too many custom roles
    - Inconsistent naming conventions
    - Lack of role documentation
    - Overlapping role responsibilities
    - Insufficient tooling for management
    
    **Resolution Steps**:
    1. Conduct a role inventory and consolidation
    2. Implement standardized role templates
    3. Document role purposes and permission sets
    4. Create a role governance process
    5. Simplify using attribute-based or dynamic assignments
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Identity Synchronization Problems">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/identity-sync.png" alt="Identity Synchronization Problems" />
    </Frame>
    
    When enterprise identity integration isn't working correctly:
    
    **Common Causes**:
    - Configuration errors in SSO setup
    - Directory attribute mapping issues
    - Group membership not syncing
    - Timing problems in provisioning
    - Network or connectivity failures
    
    **Resolution Steps**:
    1. Verify identity provider configuration
    2. Check attribute mappings and transformations
    3. Test synchronization process manually
    4. Review synchronization logs for errors
    5. Confirm network connectivity and firewall rules

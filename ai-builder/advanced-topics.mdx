# Advanced Topics

As you become proficient with AI Builder's core capabilities, you can leverage advanced techniques to build more sophisticated, powerful, and efficient applications. This guide explores advanced topics that will help you take your AI Builder implementations to the next level.

## Event-Driven Architecture Patterns

Leverage sophisticated event patterns for complex applications:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Event Sourcing">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/event-sourcing.png" alt="Event Sourcing Pattern" />
    </Frame>
    
    Store state changes as a sequence of events:
    
    - **Event Log**: Maintain an immutable record of all events
    - **State Reconstruction**: Rebuild state by replaying events
    - **Temporal Queries**: Examine system state at any point in time
    - **Event Projections**: Create specialized views of event data
    - **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all changes
    
    Event sourcing provides exceptional auditability and enables complex temporal analysis.
    
    ```javascript
    // Example event sourcing implementation in an automation
    
    // Store an event in the log
    async function logEvent(eventType, payload) {
      const event = {
        id: generateUUID(),
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        type: eventType,
        payload: payload
      };
      
      // Append event to the log (stored in a database, file, etc.)
      await appendToEventLog(event);
      
      // Optionally update current state projection
      await updateStateProjection(event);
      
      return event.id;
    }
    
    // Rebuild state by replaying events
    async function rebuildState(entityId, upToTimestamp = null) {
      // Retrieve relevant events from log
      const events = await getEventsByEntity(entityId, upToTimestamp);
      
      // Initialize empty state
      let state = {};
      
      // Apply each event to evolve the state
      for (const event of events) {
        state = applyEvent(state, event);
      }
      
      return state;
    }
    
    // Apply event to update state
    function applyEvent(state, event) {
      switch(event.type) {
        case 'ITEM_CREATED':
          return { ...state, ...event.payload, created: event.timestamp };
        case 'PROPERTY_UPDATED':
          return { ...state, [event.payload.property]: event.payload.value, updated: event.timestamp };
        case 'ITEM_DELETED':
          return { ...state, deleted: true, deletedAt: event.timestamp };
        default:
          return state;
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="CQRS Pattern">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/cqrs-pattern.png" alt="CQRS Pattern" />
    </Frame>
    
    Separate read and write operations for optimization:
    
    - **Command Side**: Handles create/update/delete operations
    - **Query Side**: Optimized for reading and reporting
    - **Eventual Consistency**: Synchronization between sides
    - **Specialized Models**: Different data models for different needs
    - **Performance Optimization**: Each side optimized for its purpose
    
    Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) improves performance and scalability for complex applications.
    
    ```javascript
    // Example CQRS implementation in AI Builder
    
    // Command handling (write operations)
    async function handleCommand(command) {
      // Validate command
      validateCommand(command);
      
      // Process command to generate events
      const events = processCommand(command);
      
      // Store events (using event sourcing pattern)
      for (const event of events) {
        await logEvent(event.type, event.payload);
      }
      
      // Return command result
      return { success: true, commandId: command.id, eventCount: events.length };
    }
    
    // Query handling (read operations)
    async function handleQuery(query) {
      // Determine which read model to use
      const readModel = getAppropriateReadModel(query);
      
      // Execute query against read model
      const result = await readModel.execute(query);
      
      return result;
    }
    
    // Update read models from events
    async function updateReadModels(event) {
      // Get all read models that need this event
      const relevantReadModels = getRelevantReadModels(event);
      
      // Update each read model
      for (const readModel of relevantReadModels) {
        await readModel.applyEvent(event);
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Saga Pattern">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/saga-pattern.png" alt="Saga Pattern" />
    </Frame>
    
    Manage complex, distributed transactions:
    
    - **Sequential Steps**: Series of related operations
    - **Compensating Actions**: Rollback mechanisms for failures
    - **State Tracking**: Monitor progress through the saga
    - **Coordination**: Orchestrate across multiple systems
    - **Recovery**: Handle interruptions and failures
    
    Sagas enable reliable execution of multi-step processes across distributed components.
    
    ```javascript
    // Example saga implementation for a multi-step business process
    
    // Define the saga steps and compensations
    const orderProcessingSaga = {
      steps: [
        {
          name: 'validateInventory',
          execute: async (context) => {
            // Check if items are in stock
            const result = await checkInventory(context.items);
            if (!result.available) {
              throw new Error('Items not available');
            }
            return { ...context, inventoryValidated: true };
          },
          compensate: async (context) => {
            // No compensation needed for validation
            return context;
          }
        },
        {
          name: 'processPayment',
          execute: async (context) => {
            // Process the payment
            const paymentResult = await chargePayment(context.paymentDetails, context.amount);
            return { ...context, paymentId: paymentResult.id, paymentProcessed: true };
          },
          compensate: async (context) => {
            // Refund the payment if it was processed
            if (context.paymentProcessed) {
              await refundPayment(context.paymentId);
            }
            return { ...context, paymentProcessed: false };
          }
        },
        {
          name: 'allocateInventory',
          execute: async (context) => {
            // Allocate inventory for the order
            await allocateItems(context.items);
            return { ...context, inventoryAllocated: true };
          },
          compensate: async (context) => {
            // Release allocated inventory
            if (context.inventoryAllocated) {
              await releaseItems(context.items);
            }
            return { ...context, inventoryAllocated: false };
          }
        },
        {
          name: 'createShipment',
          execute: async (context) => {
            // Create shipment for the order
            const shipment = await createShipment(context.shippingDetails);
            return { ...context, shipmentId: shipment.id, shipmentCreated: true };
          },
          compensate: async (context) => {
            // Cancel shipment if created
            if (context.shipmentCreated) {
              await cancelShipment(context.shipmentId);
            }
            return { ...context, shipmentCreated: false };
          }
        }
      ]
    };
    
    // Execute the saga
    async function executeSaga(saga, initialContext) {
      let context = { ...initialContext, sagaId: generateUUID() };
      let currentStepIndex = 0;
      
      try {
        // Store initial saga state
        await storeSagaState(context.sagaId, { status: 'STARTED', context });
        
        // Execute each step in sequence
        for (currentStepIndex = 0; currentStepIndex < saga.steps.length; currentStepIndex++) {
          const step = saga.steps[currentStepIndex];
          
          // Update saga state to show current step
          await storeSagaState(context.sagaId, { 
            status: 'EXECUTING', 
            currentStep: step.name, 
            stepIndex: currentStepIndex,

        return { success: true, context };
        
      } catch (error) {
        // Failure occurred, begin compensation
        await storeSagaState(context.sagaId, { 
          status: 'COMPENSATING', 
          error: error.message,
          context 
        });
        
        // Execute compensation steps in reverse order
        for (let i = currentStepIndex; i >= 0; i--) {
          const step = saga.steps[i];
          
          try {
            context = await step.compensate(context);
          } catch (compensationError) {
            // Log compensation error but continue with other compensations
            console.error(`Compensation error in step ${step.name}:`, compensationError);
          }
        }
        
        await storeSagaState(context.sagaId, { status: 'COMPENSATED', context });
        return { success: false, error: error.message, context };
      }

## Advanced State Management

Implement sophisticated state handling for complex applications:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hierarchical State">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/hierarchical-state.png" alt="Hierarchical State Management" />
    </Frame>
    
    Organize state in nested structures:
    
    - **State Hierarchy**: Parent-child relationships between states
    - **Inheritance**: Child states inherit properties from parents
    - **State Nesting**: States can contain substates
    - **Transition Rules**: Define how states can change
    - **Context Sharing**: Pass context between state levels
    
    Hierarchical state management is ideal for complex workflows with nested processes.
    
    ```javascript
    // Example hierarchical state machine implementation
    class HierarchicalStateMachine {
      constructor(config) {
        this.states = config.states || {};
        this.initialState = config.initialState;
        this.currentState = null;
        this.stateStack = [];
        this.context = config.initialContext || {};
      }
      
      // Start the state machine
      start() {
        this.transition(this.initialState);
        return this.context;
      }
      
      // Trigger an event
      trigger(event, payload = {}) {
        const currentStateObj = this.states[this.currentState];
        
        // Check if the current state handles this event
        if (currentStateObj.on && currentStateObj.on[event]) {
          const transition = currentStateObj.on[event];
          
          // Execute the action if defined
          if (transition.action) {
            this.context = transition.action(this.context, payload);
          }
          
          // Transition to the target state if defined
          if (transition.target) {
            this.transition(transition.target);
          }
          
          return this.context;
        }
        
        // If current state doesn't handle the event, check parent state
        if (currentStateObj.parent) {
          // Save current state to return to it
          this.stateStack.push(this.currentState);
          
          // Move to parent state to handle the event
          this.currentState = currentStateObj.parent;
          return this.trigger(event, payload);
        }
        
        // No handler found for this event
        console.warn(`No handler found for event ${event} in state ${this.currentState}`);
        return this.context;
      }
      
      // Transition to a new state
      transition(targetState) {
        const currentStateObj = this.currentState ? this.states[this.currentState] : null;
        const targetStateObj = this.states[targetState];
        
        if (!targetStateObj) {
          throw new Error(`Target state ${targetState} does not exist`);
        }
        
        // Exit current state
        if (currentStateObj && currentStateObj.onExit) {
          this.context = currentStateObj.onExit(this.context);
        }
        
        // Update current state
        this.currentState = targetState;
        
        // Enter new state
        if (targetStateObj.onEnter) {
          this.context = targetStateObj.onEnter(this.context);
        }
        
        // If new state has an initial substate, transition to it
        if (targetStateObj.initial) {
          this.stateStack.push(targetState);
          this.transition(targetStateObj.initial);
        }
        
        return this.context;
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Distributed State">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/distributed-state.png" alt="Distributed State Management" />
    </Frame>
    
    Manage state across distributed components:
    
    - **Consistency Protocols**: Ensure state agreement across nodes
    - **State Synchronization**: Keep components updated with latest data
    - **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent updates to the same data
    - **Partition Tolerance**: Function despite network issues between components
    - **Eventual Consistency**: Balance between consistency and availability
    
    Distributed state management is essential for multi-user applications and distributed systems. It uses mechanisms like vector clocks to track change history and resolve conflicts when multiple nodes update the same data simultaneously. This approach ensures all system parts eventually converge to a consistent state even when temporarily disconnected.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Reactive State Management">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/reactive-state.png" alt="Reactive State Management" />
    </Frame>
    
    Build responsive, data-driven applications:
    
    - **Observable Patterns**: State changes automatically notify subscribers
    - **Data Streams**: Process continuous flows of state updates
    - **Reactive Programming**: Declare relationships between data and UI
    - **Change Propagation**: Updates cascade through dependent components
    - **Side Effect Management**: Handle external operations triggered by state changes
    
    Reactive state management creates highly responsive applications that automatically update when underlying data changes. This pattern separates state management logic from UI concerns, making applications more maintainable and predictable. It's particularly useful for real-time dashboards, collaborative tools, and applications with complex data flows.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Persistent State">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/persistent-state.png" alt="Persistent State Management" />
    </Frame>
    
    Maintain state across sessions and system restarts:
    
    - **Storage Strategies**: Different persistence mechanisms for different needs
    - **State Serialization**: Convert complex state to storable formats
    - **Hydration/Rehydration**: Restore state from persistent storage
    - **Version Migration**: Handle changes to state structure over time
    - **Selective Persistence**: Store only necessary parts of state
    
    Persistent state ensures application data survives across user sessions and system restarts. Implementation strategies range from local storage for user preferences to distributed databases for shared application state. Proper state migration strategies are crucial when the application evolves, ensuring older stored states can be properly loaded into newer application versions.

## Advanced AI Integration Patterns

Implement sophisticated AI capabilities in your applications:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Multi-Agent Orchestration">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/multi-agent-orchestration.png" alt="Multi-Agent Orchestration" />
    </Frame>
    
    Coordinate multiple specialized AI agents:
    
    - **Agent Specialization**: Different agents for different tasks
    - **Orchestration Layer**: Coordinate agent interactions
    - **Context Sharing**: Pass information between agents
    - **Workflow Management**: Control sequence of agent activities
    - **Result Synthesis**: Combine outputs from multiple agents
    
    Multi-agent orchestration creates AI systems that leverage specialized agents for different tasks while maintaining a coherent user experience. For example, one agent might handle natural language understanding, another might retrieve information from a knowledge base, and a third might generate visualizations. The orchestration layer determines which agents to involve and how to combine their capabilities for each user request.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Hybrid RAG Architectures">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/hybrid-rag.png" alt="Hybrid RAG Architectures" />
    </Frame>
    
    Combine multiple retrieval strategies for optimal results:
    
    - **Multi-Stage Retrieval**: Sequential filtering and ranking
    - **Multi-Vector Retrieval**: Different embedding models for different content
    - **Cross-Encoder Reranking**: Precise relevance scoring after initial retrieval
    - **Fusion Techniques**: Combine results from different retrieval methods
    - **Adaptive Retrieval**: Context-dependent retrieval strategies
    
    Hybrid RAG architectures go beyond basic retrieval-augmented generation by combining multiple strategies. For example, a system might use fast keyword search for initial retrieval, then apply semantic search to this subset, and finally rerank using a more compute-intensive cross-encoder model. These approaches achieve higher accuracy while maintaining reasonable performance, adapting to the specific characteristics of different queries and knowledge bases.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Agentic AI Systems">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/agentic-ai.png" alt="Agentic AI Systems" />
    </Frame>
    
    Build autonomous AI systems that can reason and act:
    
    - **Reasoning Frameworks**: Enable step-by-step problem solving
    - **Tool Use**: AI selects and uses appropriate tools
    - **Action Planning**: Determine sequences of actions to achieve goals
    - **Self-Monitoring**: Track progress and adjust approaches
    - **Environmental Interaction**: Engage with external systems and data
    
    Agentic AI systems can autonomously plan and execute multi-step processes to accomplish complex tasks. They combine large language models with a toolkit of specialized capabilities, decision-making frameworks, and goal-oriented planning. These systems can independently determine what tools to use, when to use them, and how to interpret the results, creating AI assistants that handle sophisticated workflows with minimal human guidance.

## Performance Optimization

Techniques for building high-performance AI applications:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Caching Strategies">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/caching-strategies.png" alt="Caching Strategies" />
    </Frame>
    
    Improve response times and reduce computational load:
    
    - **Multi-Level Caching**: Different caching tiers for different needs
    - **Cache Invalidation**: Strategies for keeping cache fresh
    - **Content-Based Caching**: Cache based on input characteristics
    - **Predictive Caching**: Pre-load likely-to-be-requested data
    - **Distributed Caching**: Share cache across application instances
    
    Effective caching dramatically improves application performance, especially for compute-intensive AI operations. For LLM applications, caching similar queries and responses can reduce both latency and operational costs. Cache strategies must balance freshness against performance, with invalidation policies tailored to how frequently different types of data change.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Asynchronous Processing">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/asynchronous-processing.png" alt="Asynchronous Processing" />
    </Frame>
    
    Handle long-running operations without blocking:
    
    - **Background Processing**: Execute operations outside request cycle
    - **Message Queues**: Manage work items for asynchronous processing
    - **Webhooks**: Notify when async operations complete
    - **Polling**: Client-side checking for completion
    - **Status Tracking**: Monitor progress of long-running tasks
    
    Asynchronous processing patterns are essential for maintaining responsive applications when operations take substantial time to complete. For AI workloads like large document processing or complex inference tasks, async processing ensures the user interface remains responsive while work happens in the background. These patterns often involve breaking work into smaller chunks, processing them independently, and then aggregating results.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Resource Optimization">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/resource-optimization.png" alt="Resource Optimization" />
    </Frame>
    
    Efficiently use computational resources:
    
    - **Load Balancing**: Distribute work across available resources
    - **Autoscaling**: Dynamically adjust resource allocation
    - **Resource Pooling**: Reuse expensive resources like connections
    - **Batch Processing**: Group similar operations for efficiency
    - **Prioritization**: Allocate resources based on request importance
    
    Resource optimization ensures AI applications can operate efficiently at scale. For example, batching multiple LLM inference requests together can significantly increase throughput while reducing costs. Similarly, implementing connection pools for database access and API requests prevents resource exhaustion during peak loads. Effective resource management requires monitoring, setting appropriate limits, and implementing graceful degradation for overload scenarios.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Network Optimization">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/network-optimization.png" alt="Network Optimization" />
    </Frame>
    
    Reduce latency and bandwidth usage:
    
    - **Request Batching**: Combine multiple requests
    - **Compression**: Reduce data size for transmission
    - **Protocol Selection**: Choose appropriate communication protocols
    - **Connection Reuse**: Maintain persistent connections
    - **Edge Computing**: Process data closer to users
    
    Network optimization is particularly important for distributed AI applications where components may be geographically dispersed. Techniques like request batching reduce the overhead of multiple small requests, while compression minimizes bandwidth usage for large data transfers. For global applications, edge deployment brings computation closer to users, reducing latency and improving user experience.

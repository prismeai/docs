description: 'Create multi-step AI processing workflows for complex tasks'
---

The AI Pipeline Agent template enables you to create sophisticated multi-step AI workflows that can handle complex business processes. By connecting multiple AI models, tools, and data sources in a sequential pipeline, you can automate processes that require several stages of analysis, transformation, or decision-making.

## Template Overview

This template provides the foundation for building AI pipelines:

- Modular pipeline architecture
- Step-by-step workflow configuration
- Input/output management between steps
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Execution monitoring and logging

## Performance Optimization

- **Step Caching**: Cache results of expensive operations to improve performance
- **Concurrency Control**: Adjust parallel execution based on available resources
- **Timeout Management**: Set appropriate timeouts for each pipeline step
- **Error Recovery**: Configure retry strategies for transient failures

## Next Steps

After implementing this template, you can:

- Connect your pipeline to external systems using the [Autonomous Agent with Tools](/resources/templates/autonomous-agent-tools) template
- Explore how to build custom tools in the [AI Builder documentation](/products/ai-builder/overview)
- Learn about webhook integration for trigger-based pipelines in our [Webhook Builder tutorial](/resources/tutorials/webhook-builder)
- Enhance your pipelines with database integration using [AI Collection](/products/ai-collection/overview)

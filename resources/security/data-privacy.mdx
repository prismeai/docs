    - Authentication credentials (securely stored and encrypted)
    - User preferences and settings
    - Activity logs for security and audit purposes
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Content Data">
    Information you create or upload to the platform including:
    - Documents and files uploaded to knowledge bases
    - Chat histories and interactions with AI agents
    - Workspace and project configurations
    - Custom prompts and AI settings
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="System Data">
    Technical information required for operations:

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Data Processing

Prisme.ai processes your data in the following ways:

1. **Service Provision**: To deliver our core platform functionality
2. **Performance Optimization**: To improve response times and system reliability
3. **Security Monitoring**: To protect against threats and unauthorized access
4. **Analytics**: To provide insights about usage patterns and feature adoption

Data processing activities are governed by our Terms of Service and Data Processing Agreement (DPA) available to enterprise customers.

## Data Segregation and Multi-Tenancy

Prisme.ai implements robust data segregation to ensure information from different customers remains separate and secure:

- **Logical Segregation**: Data is partitioned at the database and application layers
- **Access Controls**: Fine-grained permission systems prevent unauthorized cross-tenant access
- **Tenant Isolation**: Processing resources are isolated to prevent performance impact between tenants

For enterprise deployments, dedicated infrastructure options are available for enhanced isolation.

## Data Sovereignty and Residency

Prisme.ai offers options to maintain data within specific geographical regions to comply with local regulations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Regional Deployments">
    Choose where your Prisme.ai instance is hosted based on your compliance requirements
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Storage Controls">
    Configure where your data is stored and processed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Processing Boundaries">
    Set boundaries for where data processing can occur
  </Step>
</Steps>

## AI and Machine Learning Privacy Considerations

When using AI and machine learning features in Prisme.ai, additional privacy considerations apply:

<Note>
Prisme.ai's approach to AI privacy focuses on keeping you in control of how your data is used with AI models. We provide transparency about when information is sent to external AI services and offer options for using local models when data must remain within your environment.
</Note>

### LLM Data Usage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How LLMs Use Your Data">
    When you use large language models (LLMs) within Prisme.ai, your data may be processed by these models to generate responses. This might include:
    
    - Queries you enter in chat interfaces
    - Documents processed by the RAG system
    - Contextual information provided to the AI
    
    The extent of data sharing depends on whether you're using Prisme.ai's built-in models, your own deployed models, or third-party AI services.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="External AI Service Privacy">
    When using external AI services (such as OpenAI's GPT models, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic's Claude, etc.):
    
    - Data is transmitted to these services for processing
    - Each service has its own privacy policies regarding data retention and usage
    - Prisme.ai configures these integrations with privacy-preserving defaults
    
    Enterprise customers can configure which external services are permitted and which are restricted based on their compliance requirements.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="On-Premises AI Options">
    For organizations with stricter data privacy requirements, Prisme.ai offers:
    
    - Support for locally deployed open-source LLMs
    - Integration with private AI deployments
    - Hybrid approaches that use local models for sensitive data
    
    These options ensure that data never leaves your environment while still leveraging AI capabilities.
  </Accordion>

- **Usage Transparency**: View how user data is being utilized within the platform
- **Data Subject Rights**: Tools to help fulfill requests related to personal data

## Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation

Prisme.ai follows data minimization principles, collecting only what's necessary to provide our services:

1. **Collection Limitation**: We only collect data needed for legitimate purposes

### Example of a Good Support Request

```
Subject: Error when uploading documents to AI Knowledge project

Description:
When uploading PDF documents larger than 10MB to our "Customer Support" AI Knowledge project, the upload appears to complete successfully, but the documents remain in "Processing" status indefinitely.

Error Message:
No explicit error is shown, but in the browser console I see:
"Error: Request entity too large" with status code 413.

Environment:
- Prisme.ai SaaS (not self-hosted)
- Chrome 120.0.6099.109
- Windows 11
- Corporate network with proxy

Reproduction Steps:
1. Log in to Prisme.ai
2. Navigate to AI Knowledge > Projects > Customer Support
3. Click "Add Document"
4. Select a PDF file larger than 10MB
5. Click "Upload"
6. Document appears in the list with "Processing" status
7. Wait 30+ minutes, status never changes

Impact:
This is blocking our team from uploading our product manuals, which are typically 15-20MB. We need to complete this by Friday for an upcoming product launch.

Screenshots:
[attached]

Additional Information:
Smaller PDFs (under 10MB) upload and process normally. This issue started occurring yesterday. We've tried from different computers with the same result.
```

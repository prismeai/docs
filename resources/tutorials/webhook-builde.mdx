---


This tutorial shows you how to build powerful automations that combine webhooks, APIs, and AI capabilities. You'll learn to create a system that can receive data via webhooks, process it with custom code, and use AI to generate intelligent summariesâ€”all without managing traditional databases.

## What You'll Build

A complete API and webhook integration with:
- A webhook endpoint to receive external data
- Custom code processing for data transformation
- AI-powered text summarization using Knowledge Client
- Seamless event-driven communication between components

<Note>
This solution demonstrates how Prisme.ai can transform simple API integrations into intelligent data processing systems using generative AI to extract insights from incoming data.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:

- An active Prisme.ai account
- The Knowledge Client app installed in your workspace
- The Custom Code app installed in your workspace

## Step 1: Creating Your Workspace

Let's start by setting up a dedicated workspace for our webhook integrations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access AI Builder">
    Log in to your Prisme.ai account and navigate to the AI Builder product
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Workspace">
    Click the "Create Workspace" button to start a new project
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Workspace Settings">
    - Name your workspace "AI API Integrator" (or a name of your choice)
    - Add an appropriate description and icon
    - Configure any additional settings as needed
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Creating the Summary Generation Automation

First, let's create the automation that will use AI to generate summaries from JSON data:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Automations">
    In your workspace, go to the Automations section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Automation">
    Click "Create Automation" and configure the following:
    - Name: "Generate Summary"
    - Slug: "generate-summary"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Automation">
    Use the following YAML configuration:
    
    ```yaml
    slug: generate-summary
    name: Generate Summary
    do:
      - set:
          name: stringifiedData
          value: '{% json({{payload.data}}) %}'
      - Knowledge Client.chat-completion:
          messages:
            - role: system
              content: Create a brief summary from a JSON object, focusing on key details and overarching information contained within, ensuring clarity and conciseness in the summary.
            - role: user
              content: '{{stringifiedData}}'
          output: genAIData
    when:
      events:
        - summary-event
    output: '{{genAIData.response}}'
    ```
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/summary-automation.png" alt="Summary Generation Automation" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Automation">
    Click "Save" to create your summary generation automation
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Notice that we first parse the JSON object as a string using the `json()` utility function. This is necessary because language models expect text input, not structured JSON. Learn more about this in the [condition documentation](https://docs.eda.prisme.ai/en/workspaces/conditions.md#conditions).
</Note>

## Step 3: Creating the Webhook Automation

Now, let's create the webhook automation that will receive data and trigger the summary generation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Another Automation">
    Back in the Automations section, click "Create Automation" again
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Webhook Automation">
    Use the following settings:
    - Name: "Webhook"
    - Slug: "webhook"
    - Trigger: Enable "Endpoint" to make it accessible via URL
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up the Automation Logic">
    Configure the automation with this YAML:
    
    ```yaml
    slug: webhook
    name: Webhook
    do:
      - Custom Code.run function:
          function: CleanData
          parameters:
            data: '{{query}}'
          output: cleanData
      - emit:
          payload:
            body: '{{body}}'
            headers: '{{headers}}'
            data: '{{cleanData}}'
          event: summary-event
    when:
      endpoint: true
    output:
      message: '{{cleanData}}'
    ```
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/webhook-automation.png" alt="Webhook Automation" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Webhook Automation">
    Click "Save" to create your webhook endpoint automation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Your Webhook URL">
    - Click on the "Triggered when" section of your automation
    - Look for the blue "Get the link" button and click it
    - Copy the displayed URL, which will look like: `https://api.studio.prisme.ai/v2/workspaces/YOUR-WorkspaceID/webhooks/webhook`
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/get-webhook-endpoint.png" alt="Get Webhook Endpoint URL" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Configuring Custom Code

Now, let's set up the Custom Code app to process our incoming data:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Custom Code App">
    Navigate to the Apps section in your workspace and open the Custom Code app
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the CleanData Function">
    Configure the Custom Code app with the following YAML:
    
    ```yaml
    appName: Custom Code
    slug: Custom Code
    config:
      functions:
        CleanData:
          code: |-
            return data;
          parameters:
            data:
              type: object
              default: [
                  {
                    "id": 1,
                    "name": "John Doe",
                    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
                    "isActive": true,
                    "roles": ["admin", "user"]
                  },
                  {
                    "id": 2,
                    "name": "Jane Smith",
                    "email": "jane.smith@example.com",
                    "isActive": false,
                    "roles": ["user"]
                  }
                ]
    ```
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/custom-code-configuration.png" alt="Custom Code Configuration" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Custom Code Configuration">
    Click "Save" to apply your Custom Code settings
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The Custom Code function includes a default value for testing purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would likely perform more complex data transformation operations here.
</Note>

## Step 5: Testing Your Webhook Integration

Let's test our webhook and see the AI summary generation in action:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare a Test Request">
    You can test your webhook by making an HTTP request to your webhook URL with query parameters, for example:
    `https://api.studio.prisme.ai/v2/workspaces/YOUR-WorkspaceID/webhooks/webhook?city=Toulouse&country=France`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send the Request">
    Use a tool like curl, Postman, or simply enter the URL in your browser to trigger the webhook
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check the Response">
    The webhook should return a message containing the clean data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Summary Generation">
    Check your activity logs to confirm that the summary-event was triggered and the AI generated a summary of the data:
    ```json
    {
      "city": "Toulouse",
      "country": "France"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding HTTP Variables in Webhooks

When working with webhooks in Prisme.ai, several HTTP variables are automatically available at the root level inside your endpoint automation:

- **query**: Contains query parameters from the URL
- **body**: Contains the request body (for POST/PUT requests)
- **headers**: Contains the HTTP request headers
- **method**: Contains the HTTP method used (GET, POST, etc.)

<Note>
In our webhook example, we're passing the `query` variable to our Custom Code function and including both `headers` and `body` in the payload that triggers the summary-event.
</Note>

## Version Control and Deployment

To manage your webhook integrations effectively:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Save Your Current State">
    Use the "Pull" button in your workspace to create a new version
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/pull-changes.png" alt="Pull Changes" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Additional Versions">
    As you make changes and improvements, create new versions to maintain a history of your work
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy Specific Versions">
    Select which version to deploy in your workspace settings
  </Step>
</Steps>

For more information, see the documentation on [Version Control](https://docs.eda.prisme.ai/en/workspaces/versioning/) and [RBAC](https://docs.eda.prisme.ai/en/workspaces/security/).

## Monitoring and Logs

Keep track of your webhook activity and performance:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Activity Logs">
    Navigate to the Activity section of your workspace to view detailed records of webhook calls, automation triggers, and AI operations
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/activity-monitoring.png" alt="Activity Monitoring" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Alerts">
    Configure alerts for critical events or errors in your automations
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze Performance">
    Use logs to identify patterns, bottlenecks, or areas for improvement
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Extending Your Webhook Integration

Your base webhook system is powerful, but consider these enhancements:

- **Authentication**: Add API key validation or OAuth to secure your webhooks
- **Enhanced Processing**: Implement more complex data transformations in your Custom Code
- **Multiple Endpoints**: Create different webhook endpoints for various data sources or purposes
- **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Integration**: Connect your webhooks to other systems like databases, messaging platforms, or CRMs

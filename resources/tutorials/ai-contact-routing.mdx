  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Default Recipient">
    Add a "Set var" instruction:
    - Variable name: "recipient"
    - Value: "hello@example.com" (a default email in case routing fails)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add OpenAI Analysis">
    Add an "OpenAI.chat-completion" instruction:
    - Model: Select "gpt-4" (or another appropriate model)
    - Messages:
      - System role: "Given the following customer inquiry, categorize it as either sales, support, or careers. Provide your categorization based on the content. Answer only with category nothing else."
      - User role: "{{payload.message}}"

    Add a "conditions" instruction with the following branches:
    - Condition: {{routingDecision}} = "sales"
      - Action: Set recipient to "sales@example.com"
    - Condition: {{routingDecision}} = "support"
      - Action: Set recipient to "support@example.com"
    - Condition: {{routingDecision}} = "careers"
      - Action: Set recipient to "careers@example.com"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Email Notification">
    Add a "SendMail.sendMail" instruction:
    - To: "{{recipient}}" (the dynamically set department email)
    - ReplyTo: "{{payload.email}}" (the submitter's email)
    - Subject: "New Contact Form Submission"
    - Body: "Message: {{payload.message}}, Name: {{payload.name}}, Attachment: {{payload.attachment}}"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Output and Save">
    - Set the automation output to "{{routingDecision}}"
    - Save your automation
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Testing Your Contact Routing System

  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit Test Inquiries">
    Fill out the form with different types of inquiries to test the routing:
    - A sales-related inquiry (e.g., "I'm interested in pricing for your enterprise plan")
    - A support-related inquiry (e.g., "I'm having trouble logging into my account")
    - A careers-related inquiry (e.g., "I'd like to apply for the marketing position")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Email Routing">
    Check that each test inquiry is routed to the correct department email
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Attachment Handling">
    Submit a form with an attachment to ensure files are properly included in the emails
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 6: Version Control and Deployment

To finalize your contact routing system:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pull Your Changes">
    Use the "Pull" button in your workspace to create a new version

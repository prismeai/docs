- **Enhanced Quality and Security**: Test and secure components in a controlled environment
- **Governance and Control**: Restrict app development to authorized users
- **Increased Productivity**: Automate routine tasks and integrate various data sources
- **Reusable Components**: Build once, use everywhere across your organization

## What You'll Build

In this tutorial, you'll create a Mailjet integration app that allows users to send emails directly from their automations. This practical example demonstrates the full app development lifecycle from creation to publication in the App Store.

<Note>
While we're using Mailjet as an example, the principles and steps apply to building any type of custom app on Prisme.ai.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:

- An active Prisme.ai account with appropriate permissions
- Basic knowledge of YAML for configuration
- API credentials from the service you're integrating (Mailjet in this example)

## Step 1: Creating Your App Workspace

First, let's create a dedicated workspace for your app:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access AI Builder">
    Log in to Prisme.ai and navigate to the Builder product
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Workspace">
    Click "Create Workspace" and configure it as follows:
    - Name: "Mailjet" (or the name of your integration)
    - Description: Brief explanation of what the app does
    - Icon: Choose an appropriate icon that represents the service
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Basic Settings">
    Set up any additional workspace settings necessary for your app
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Building the Core Automation

Now, let's create the main functionality of your app:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Automation">
    Navigate to the Automations section and click "Create Automation"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Automation">
    - Name your automation (e.g., "SendEmail")
    - Set an appropriate slug (e.g., "send-email")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define the Automation Logic">
    Click on "See Code" and paste the following YAML configuration:
    
    ```yaml
    slug: send-email
    name: SendMail
    do:
      - fetch:
          emitErrors: true
          outputMode: body
          headers:
            Content-Type: application/json
            Authorization: Basic [Base64 Encoded Credentials]
          query: {}
          url: https://api.mailjet.com/v3.1/send
          method: post
          body:
            Messages:
              - From:
                  Email: '{{fromEmail}}'
                  Name: '{{fromName}}'
                To:
                  - Email: '{{toEmail}}'
                    Name: '{{toName}}'
                Subject: '{{subject}}'
                TextPart: '{{body}}'
          output: response
    arguments:
      fromEmail:
        type: string
        placeholder: john@example.com
        title: 
         fr: From Email
         en: From Email
        description: 
         en: From Email
         fr: From Email
      fromName:
        type: string
        placeholder: john
        title:
          en: From name
          fr: From Name
      toEmail:
        type: string
        placeholder: john@example.com
        title: 
         fr: To Email
         en: To Email
        description: 
         en: To Email
         fr: To Email
      toName:
        type: string
        placeholder: john
        title:
          en: To name
          fr: To Name
      subject:
        type: string
        placeholder: Your first Email
        title: 
         fr: Object
         en: Subject
        description: 
         en: Subject
         fr: Object
      body:
        type: string
        ui:widget: html
        title: 
         fr: Corps
         en: Body
        description:
          fr: Texte ou contenu enrichi au format HTML ou Markdown
          en: Text or rich text formated with HTML ou Markdown 
    ```
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Privacy Settings">
    To ensure confidentiality, set this automation to private by adding `private: true` to the YAML configuration. This prevents workspace consumers from directly accessing the automation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Automation">
    Click "Save" to create your automation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the Automation">
    Run a test to ensure the automation works as expected with your API credentials
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Understanding the Automation Configuration

The YAML configuration above defines a workflow that:

1. Makes an HTTP POST request to the Mailjet API
2. Uses basic authentication with encoded credentials
3. Formats the request body according to Mailjet's requirements
4. Defines input arguments with user-friendly labels and placeholders
5. Supports HTML content for the email body

<Note>
The `arguments` section defines the inputs that will be exposed to users when they use your app in their own automations. Make sure these are clearly named and documented.
</Note>

## Step 3: Configuring Advanced Settings

Let's add configuration capabilities to make your app more flexible:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Configuration Schema">
    Navigate to the workspace settings and click on the "Configuration" tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Configuration Fields">
    Add the following YAML to create a configuration field for API credentials:
    
    ```yaml
    config:
      schema:
        base64_encoded_credentials:
          title: Base64 encoded credentials
          description: Base64 encoded credentials
          type: string
    ```
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Automation to Use Configuration">
    Modify your automation to use the configured credentials instead of hardcoded values
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Creating Documentation

Good documentation is essential for any app. Let's create a documentation page:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Documentation Page">
    Navigate to Pages and create a new page with the slug `_doc`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Documentation Content">
    Click on "See Code" and paste the following YAML:
    
    ```yaml
    slug: _doc
    name:
      fr: Documentation
      en: Documentation
    blocks:
      - slug: RichText
        content: |-
          <h1>Mailjet</h1> 
          <p>
            The complete solution to power your email
          </p><br />
      - slug: TabsView
        tabs:
          - type: event
            content:
              blocks:
                - slug: RichText
                  content: |- 
                    <hr />
                    <p>Hello World</p>          
            text: Documentation
          - type: external
            text: Changelog
            content:
              blocks:
                - slug: RichText
                  content: |-
                    <hr />
                     <h2>3-8-2023.3</h2>  
                     <p> Latest stable release</p>
    styles: |-
      .page-blocks {
        padding: 2rem;
      }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make Documentation Public">
    Ensure your app settings allow user access to documentation by enabling the public setting for the app
    

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Versioning and Publishing

Now that your app is built and documented, let's publish it to the App Store:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Version Your Workspace">
    Navigate to your workspace settings and click "Push" to create a new version

  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish to App Store">
    Click on "Publish" to make your app available in the Prisme.ai App Store
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Publication Settings">
    Set visibility, categorization, and other publication settings for your app
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Publication">
    Finalize the publication process
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 6: Installing and Using Your App

---


This tutorial guides you through building an intelligent document classification system using Prisme.ai. You'll create a solution that automatically categorizes uploaded documents into types such as invoices, CVs, quotes, contracts, and more using the power of generative AI.

## What You'll Build

A complete document management system with:
- A user-friendly document upload interface
- Automatic AI-based document classification
- A searchable and filterable document repository
- Document management capabilities (view, categorize, delete)

<Note>
This solution integrates AI Knowledge for classification with Collection for document storage, creating a powerful yet simple document management system.
</Note>

    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Building the Document Upload Interface

Now, let's create a user-friendly interface for document uploads and management:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Page">
    In your workspace, navigate to the Pages section and click "Create Page"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Page Properties">
    - Name your page "Document Upload Form"
    - Set the slug to "upload-docs" (this will be used in the URL)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a Form Block">
    Add a Form block to your page for document uploads with the following configuration:
    
    ```yaml
    slug: upload-docs
    name: Document Upload Form
    blocks:
      - slug: Form
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            attachment:
              type: string
              ui:widget: upload
              title: Document Upload
              description: Attach your document here.
              ui:options:
                upload:
                  accept: .pdf
            description:
              type: textarea
              title: Document Description
              placeholder: Describe the document here.
        onSubmit: save
    ```
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/form-configuration.png" alt="Configuring the Document Upload Form" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a Data Table Block">
    Add a DataTable block to display uploaded documents and their classifications:
    
    ```yaml
    - slug: DataTable
      columns:
        - label: ID
          key: id
          type: string
        - label: Description
          key: description
          type: string
        - label: Category
          key: category
          type: string
        - label: Actions
          actions:
            - label: Delete
              action:
                type: event
                value: deleteData
                payload:
                  id: ${_id}
      config:
        customProps:
          loading: true
        title:
          fr: Uploaded Documents
          en: Uploaded Documents
      updateOn: updateData
      onInit: initData
      data:
        - {}
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Your Page">
    Save your page configuration. You should now have a form for uploads and a table to display documents

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Creating the Document Classification Automation

Next, let's set up the automation that will classify documents when they're uploaded:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Automations">
    In your workspace, go to the Automations section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Document Classification Automation">
    Create a new automation named "Manage Form" with the following configuration:
    
    ```yaml
    slug: manage-form
    name: Manage Form
    do:
      - Knowledge Client.chat-completion:
          messages:
            - role: system
              content: 'Classify the document within these categories: invoice, CV, quote, contract, others. Provide your categorization based on the content.'
            - role: user
              content: '{{payload.description}}'
          output: data
      - conditions:
          '{{data.response}}':
            - set:
                name: payload.category
                value: '{{data.response}}'
                type: merge
          default:
            - emit:
                target:
                  currentSocket: true
                options:
                  persist: true
                event: error
                payload: '{{data}}'
            - set:
                name: payload.error
                value: '{{data.error.message}}'
                type: merge
      - Collection.insert:
          data: '{{payload}}'
      - emit:
          target:
            currentSocket: true
          options:
            persist: false
          event: initData
    when:
      events:
        - save
    output: '{{payload}}'
    ```
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/classification-automation.png" alt="Document Classification Automation" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Data Retrieval Automation">
    Create another automation named "Get Data" to fetch and display documents:
    
    ```yaml
    slug: get-data
    name: Get Data
    do:
      - Collection.find:
          query: {}
          output: data      
          sort:
            createdAt: -1        
      - emit:
          event: updateData
          payload:
            data: '{{data}}'
            customProps:
              loading: false  
    when:
      events:
        - initData   
    output: ''
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Document Deletion Automation">
    Create a final automation named "Delete Data" to handle document removal:
    
    ```yaml
    slug: delete-data
    name: Delete Data
    do:
      - conditions:
          '!{{payload.data._id}}':
            - break: {}            
          default: []
      - Collection.deleteOne:
          query:
            _id: '{{payload.data._id}}'
      - emit:
          target:
            currentSocket: true
          options:
            persist: true
          event: initData   
    when:
      events:
        - deleteData
    output: ''
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy Your Automations">
    Save all automations and make sure they're properly configured to work together
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Testing and Using Your Document Classification System

Now it's time to test your document management system:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Document Upload Page">
    Navigate to your document upload page using the URL format: `workspace-slug.pages.host/lang/upload-docs`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload a Test Document">
    - Upload a sample document (PDF) through the form
    - Add a description that gives context about the document's content
    - Submit the form
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Classification">
    After a moment, the document should appear in the data table with its AI-determined classification
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/document-classification-result.png" alt="Document Classification Result" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Document Management">
    Try deleting a document to ensure the delete functionality works correctly
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Version Control and Deployment

To finalize your document classification system:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Push Your Changes">
    Use the "Push" button in your workspace to save the current state of your project
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/push-changes.png" alt="Push Changes" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Version">
    Create a version of your workspace for easy rollback if needed in the future
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Access Controls">
    Set up appropriate Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to determine who can use your document management system
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Monitoring and Improving Your System

After deployment, regularly check the system's performance:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Monitor Activity Logs">
    Review the activity logs to track document uploads and classifications
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/activity-monitoring.png" alt="Activity Monitoring" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Classification Accuracy">
    Periodically check if documents are being classified correctly and refine your system as needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optimize for Performance">
    Make adjustments to improve speed and accuracy as your document volume grows
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Extending Your Document Classification System

Your base system is powerful, but consider these enhancements:

- **Advanced Classification**: Train a more specialized model for your specific document types
- **Content Extraction**: Extract key information from documents based on their category
- **Automated Workflows**: Trigger specific actions based on document type (e.g., route invoices to accounting)
- **Search Functionality**: Add search capabilities to find documents by content or metadata
- **Integration**: Connect with other systems like CRM or ERP platforms

---



This tutorial guides you through creating a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent using Prisme.ai's AI Knowledge product. You'll learn how to build an AI that can intelligently access and leverage your organization's documents to provide accurate, contextual responsesâ€”all without writing a single line of code.

## What You'll Build

A complete RAG system with:
- A customizable knowledge base containing your documents
- Vector embedding and intelligent retrieval capabilities
- An interactive chat interface for querying your documents
- Automated testing for continuous quality assurance
- Analytics for performance monitoring

<Note>
AI Knowledge functions as a RAG-as-a-Service offering, creating a collaborative environment where Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Developers, and Business Teams can efficiently work together. The platform features a unique methodology called Gen.AI Test-Driven Building, ensuring everyone operates from a single source of truth.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:

- Access to the AI Knowledge product (self-hosted or Cloud version)
- Basic understanding of prompting concepts
- Documents to integrate (web pages, PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, etc.)

## Step 1: Understanding the AI Knowledge Interface

Let's familiarize ourselves with the AI Knowledge product's interface and main components:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access AI Knowledge">
    Log in to your Prisme.ai account and navigate to the AI Knowledge product
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore the Navigation">
    The interface consists of several key sections:
    
    - **Agent**: Configure AI models, select embedding models, and set parameters
    - **Test**: Configure and manage automated tests for your AI
    - **Analytics**: Monitor KPIs like token usage, generated answers, and daily usage
    - **Help**: Access embedded product documentation
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Creating Your RAG Project

Now, let's set up your first RAG project in AI Knowledge:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Dashboard">
    Navigate to the AI Knowledge dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Agent">
    Click the "Create Agent" button to start building your RAG agent
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/create-rag-agent.png" alt="Creating a New RAG Agent" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Project Settings">
    Enter a name and description for your project that reflects its purpose
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Understanding the RAG Architecture

AI Knowledge uses a Retriever-Augmented Generation architecture that combines document retrieval with language generation:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/ai-knowledge-architecture.png" alt="AI Knowledge Architecture" />
</Frame>

This architecture allows your agent to:
1. Process and store documents as vector embeddings
2. Retrieve relevant document chunks based on user queries
3. Generate contextually accurate responses using LLMs
4. Provide sources and citations for transparency

<Note>
AI Knowledge is designed to be model-agnostic, ensuring compatibility across various LLMs for both embedding and generative tasks. This flexibility allows you to switch models as needed without rebuilding your entire knowledge base.
</Note>

## Step 4: Integrating Documents

Let's add documents to your knowledge base:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Document Integration">
    In your project, navigate to the document integration section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Documents">
    Click the "Add Document" button and upload files from your computer, or provide URLs to web content
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/adding-documents.png" alt="Adding Documents to Knowledge Base" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Document Processing">
    Adjust the document processing settings:
    
    - **Text Splitter**: Choose between static (fixed-size chunks) or dynamic (content-aware) segmentation
    - **Chunk Size**: Set the optimal size for document segments
    - **Overlap**: Configure how much content overlaps between chunks to maintain context

  </Step>
  <Step title="Process Documents">
    Start the document processing, which includes:
    
    - Document loading and parsing
    - Text extraction and cleaning
    - Segmentation into chunks
    - Vector embedding generation
    - Metadata extraction
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Testing Your RAG Agent

Now that your documents are integrated, you can start querying your knowledge base:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Chat Interface">
    Click on the "Chat" button to access the interactive interface
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/rag-chat-interface.png" alt="RAG Agent Chat Interface" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask Questions">
    Enter questions related to your documents to see how the AI responds
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Sources and Chunks">
    Examine the sources and chunks used to generate each response
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/source-chunks-view.png" alt="Sources and Chunks View" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
AI Knowledge provides full transparency by showing which document chunks were used to generate each response. This feature allows you to verify the AI's reasoning and ensure accuracy.
</Note>

## Step 6: Implementing Test-Driven Building

A unique aspect of AI Knowledge is its support for Test-Driven Building (TDB), which ensures your RAG agent performs consistently over time:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Testing Module">
    Navigate to the "Test" section in your project
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Test Suite">
    Click "Add Test" to create a new test suite for your RAG agent
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/add-test-suite.png" alt="Adding a Test Suite" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Test Cases">
    Add test cases with:
    
    - **Questions**: Queries that users might ask your agent
    - **Expected Answers**: The correct information that should be provided
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Test Settings">
    Set how often tests should run (daily, weekly, etc.) and whether they should trigger automatically
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Tests">
    Execute the tests to evaluate your agent's performance
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/test-results-view.png" alt="Test Results View" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Results">
    Analyze the test results, which include:
    
    - **Prompt and Context**: The exact prompt and context used for generating responses
    - **Generated Response**: The AI's actual response
    - **Response Evaluation**: Rating of response quality (poor, correct, good)
    - **Context Evaluation**: Rating of context relevance and accuracy
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Business experts can manually assess responses, context, and instances of hallucination. We recommend running tests after each modification to the model, prompt, AI parameters, chunk size, image inclusion settings, self-query configuration, and other adjustments.
</Note>

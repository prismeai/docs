---



This tutorial guides you through creating a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent using Prisme.ai's AI Knowledge product. You'll learn how to build an AI that can intelligently access and leverage your organization's documents to provide accurate, contextual responses—all without writing a single line of code.

## What You'll Build

A complete RAG system with:
- A customizable knowledge base containing your documents
- Vector embedding and intelligent retrieval capabilities
- An interactive chat interface for querying your documents
- Automated testing for continuous quality assurance
- Analytics for performance monitoring

<Note>
AI Knowledge functions as a RAG-as-a-Service offering, creating a collaborative environment where Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Developers, and Business Teams can efficiently work together. The platform features a unique methodology called Gen.AI Test-Driven Building, ensuring everyone operates from a single source of truth.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:

- Access to the AI Knowledge product (self-hosted or Cloud version)
- Basic understanding of prompting concepts
- Documents to integrate (web pages, PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, etc.)

## Step 1: Understanding the AI Knowledge Interface

Let's familiarize ourselves with the AI Knowledge product's interface and main components:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access AI Knowledge">
    Log in to your Prisme.ai account and navigate to the AI Knowledge product
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore the Navigation">
    The interface consists of several key sections:
    
    - **Agent**: Configure AI models, select embedding models, and set parameters
    - **Test**: Configure and manage automated tests for your AI
    - **Analytics**: Monitor KPIs like token usage, generated answers, and daily usage
    - **Help**: Access embedded product documentation
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Creating Your RAG Project

Now, let's set up your first RAG project in AI Knowledge:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Dashboard">
    Navigate to the AI Knowledge dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Agent">
    Click the "Create Agent" button to start building your RAG agent
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/create-rag-agent.png" alt="Creating a New RAG Agent" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Project Settings">
    Enter a name and description for your project that reflects its purpose
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Understanding the RAG Architecture

AI Knowledge uses a Retriever-Augmented Generation architecture that combines document retrieval with language generation:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/ai-knowledge-architecture.png" alt="AI Knowledge Architecture" />
</Frame>

This architecture allows your agent to:
1. Process and store documents as vector embeddings
2. Retrieve relevant document chunks based on user queries
3. Generate contextually accurate responses using LLMs
4. Provide sources and citations for transparency

<Note>
AI Knowledge is designed to be model-agnostic, ensuring compatibility across various LLMs for both embedding and generative tasks. This flexibility allows you to switch models as needed without rebuilding your entire knowledge base.
</Note>

## Step 4: Integrating Documents

Let's add documents to your knowledge base:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Document Integration">
    In your project, navigate to the document integration section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Documents">
    Click the "Add Document" button and upload files from your computer, or provide URLs to web content
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/adding-documents.png" alt="Adding Documents to Knowledge Base" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Document Processing">
    Adjust the document processing settings:
    
    - **Text Splitter**: Choose between static (fixed-size chunks) or dynamic (content-aware) segmentation
    - **Chunk Size**: Set the optimal size for document segments
    - **Overlap**: Configure how much content overlaps between chunks to maintain context

  </Step>
  <Step title="Process Documents">
    Start the document processing, which includes:
    
    - Document loading and parsing
    - Text extraction and cleaning
    - Segmentation into chunks
    - Vector embedding generation
    - Metadata extraction
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Testing Your RAG Agent

Now that your documents are integrated, you can start querying your knowledge base:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Chat Interface">
    Click on the "Chat" button to access the interactive interface
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/rag-chat-interface.png" alt="RAG Agent Chat Interface" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask Questions">
    Enter questions related to your documents to see how the AI responds
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Sources and Chunks">
    Examine the sources and chunks used to generate each response
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/source-chunks-view.png" alt="Sources and Chunks View" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
AI Knowledge provides full transparency by showing which document chunks were used to generate each response. This feature allows you to verify the AI's reasoning and ensure accuracy.
</Note>

## Step 6: Implementing Test-Driven Building

A unique aspect of AI Knowledge is its support for Test-Driven Building (TDB), which ensures your RAG agent performs consistently over time:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Testing Module">
    Navigate to the "Test" section in your project
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Test Suite">
    Click "Add Test" to create a new test suite for your RAG agent
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/add-test-suite.png" alt="Adding a Test Suite" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Test Cases">
    Add test cases with:
    
    - **Questions**: Queries that users might ask your agent
    - **Expected Answers**: The correct information that should be provided
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Test Settings">
    Set how often tests should run (daily, weekly, etc.) and whether they should trigger automatically
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Tests">
    Execute the tests to evaluate your agent's performance
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/test-results-view.png" alt="Test Results View" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Results">
    Analyze the test results, which include:
    
    - **Prompt and Context**: The exact prompt and context used for generating responses
    - **Generated Response**: The AI's actual response
    - **Response Evaluation**: Rating of response quality (poor, correct, good)
    - **Context Evaluation**: Rating of context relevance and accuracy
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Business experts can manually assess responses, context, and instances of hallucination. We recommend running tests after each modification to the model, prompt, AI parameters, chunk size, image inclusion settings, self-query configuration, and other adjustments.
</Note>

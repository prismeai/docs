---

Prisme.ai provides comprehensive user access management capabilities to ensure the right people have access to the right resources. This guide explains how to configure and manage user access, roles, and permissions across the platform.

## Access Control Overview

Prisme.ai uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system, combined with fine-grained permissions. This allows for flexible access management that can adapt to your organization's security requirements.

The key components of Prisme.ai's access control system:

1. **Users** - Individual accounts
2. **Groups** - Collections of users
3. **Roles** - Sets of permissions
4. **Resources** - Platform components that can have permissions applied
5. **Permissions** - Specific actions that can be performed on resources

</Frame>

Key concepts for nested groups:
- Parent groups can contain child groups
- Permissions can be inherited from parent groups
- Users can be members of multiple groups
- Group nesting supports up to 5 levels deep

## Role Management

Roles are collections of permissions that can be assigned to users or groups.

### Default Roles

Prisme.ai comes with several pre-defined roles:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Administrator | Full access to all platform features and settings |
| Manager | Can manage users, groups, and resources within their scope |
| Creator | Can create and manage AI agents and knowledge bases |
| User | Basic access to use existing agents and resources |
| Guest | Limited access, typically for external collaborators |

### Custom Roles

You can create custom roles to match your organization's specific needs:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access role management">
    Navigate to Admin > Role Management.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/role-management.png" alt="Role management" />

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a new role">
    Click "Create Role" and provide:
    - Role name

      <img src="/images/create-role.png" alt="Create role" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure permissions">
    Set specific permissions for the role:
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/role-permissions.png" alt="Role permissions" />
    </Frame>
    
    Permissions are organized by:
    - Product (AI SecureChat, AI Store, etc.)
    - Resource type (agents, knowledge bases, etc.)
    - Operation (view, create, edit, delete, etc.)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assign the role">
    Assign the new role to users or groups:
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/role-assignment.png" alt="Role assignment" />
    </Frame>
    
    You can also set role assignments to be:
    - Permanent
    - Temporary (with expiration date)
    - Conditional (based on group membership or other factors)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Resource-Level Permissions

In addition to role-based permissions, Prisme.ai allows for fine-grained control at the resource level.

### Setting Resource Permissions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access resource settings">
    Navigate to the resource (agent, knowledge base, etc.) and select "Permissions".
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/resource-permissions.png" alt="Resource permissions" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure sharing settings">
    Choose how the resource is shared:
    - Private (only accessible to the creator)
    - Shared with specific users/groups
    - Public within the organization
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/sharing-settings.png" alt="Sharing settings" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set specific permissions">
    For shared resources, you can set specific permissions for each user or group:

    - Manage (includes sharing)
    - Full control
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/specific-permissions.png" alt="Specific permissions" />

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Permission Inheritance

Permissions in Prisme.ai follow an inheritance model:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/permission-inheritance.png" alt="Permission inheritance" />
</Frame>

The inheritance rules are:
1. More specific permissions override more general ones
2. Resource-level permissions override role-based permissions
3. Explicit deny always overrides any allow permissions
4. User-specific permissions override group permissions

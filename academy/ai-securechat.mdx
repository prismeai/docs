AI Secure Chat is Prisme.ai’s secure, compliant, and collaborative chat environment. It enables enterprise users to interact with multiple large language models (LLMs) — whether self-hosted or cloud-based — while ensuring end-to-end data protection, auditability, and governance control.

Advanced features and tools such as web browsing, deep research, and the interactive canvas are natively created and maintained by Prisme.ai, and they work seamlessly across all supported LLMs, regardless of the hosting environment.

## Business Context

In large organizations, Generative AI adoption faces two main challenges:

1. **Security and compliance** — ensuring that no confidential or regulated information leaves the organization.
2. **Governance and traceability** — providing visibility into who interacts with AI, what data is used, and how responses are shared.

AI Secure Chat addresses these issues by offering a **controlled, auditable interface** where every message, document, and file is securely managed under enterprise policies.

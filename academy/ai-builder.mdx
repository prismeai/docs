description: "Learn how to use AI Builder — Prisme.ai’s orchestration platform for connecting agents, tools, and enterprise systems through low-code automation."
---

AI Builder is the **core orchestration layer** of Prisme.ai. It empowers both technical and functional teams to seamlessly connect agents, data sources, and enterprise systems — enabling the automation of end-to-end workflows and the deployment of autonomous agents within a secure, event-driven architecture.

AI Builder is where business logic, automation, and intelligence converge.\
It supports YAML based automations, real-time event handling, and deep integrations with apps, APIs, and MCP tools.

The key differentiator of AI Builder is its ability to integrate legacy systems and custom connectors using YAML—up to 10× faster than traditional development—into the AI Marketplace of Apps, enabling teams to rapidly bootstrap agents and unlock high-value automation across the enterprise.

## Business Context

For large enterprises, scaling Generative AI means more than deploying chatbots — it requires **orchestrating multiple agents, tools, and processes** across secure environments.

AI Builder enables this orchestration by:

- Bridging AI agents with corporate data and APIs.
- Automating repetitive tasks through low-code workflows.
- Coordinating complex, multi-agent interactions securely.
- Maintaining compliance and observability throughout automation pipelines.

    **Objective of the use case:**\
    Learn how to use the **Website-to-Agent** template to automatically crawl a website and inject its content into an AI Knowledge base.

    **What you’ll see:**

    - Duplicating a ready-to-use **AI Builder workspace**.
    - Connecting your **AI Knowledge agent** using its Agent ID and API key.
    - Configuring the **Knowledge Client app** and the **Crawler app**.
    - Setting a target website URL and launching a crawl operation.
    - Monitoring the **crawling status dashboard** and viewing extracted page content.
    - Observing pages being converted into documents in AI Knowledge.
    - Verifying source integrity and testing retrieval in chat.
    - Reviewing automation YAML logic (event listeners and functions).
    - Understanding how the builder keeps documents up to date automatically.

    **Result:**\
    The Website-to-Agent template demonstrates how AI Builder automates the ingestion of external data into a governed AI Knowledge workspace — ensuring continuous updates and consistency.

    **Objective of the use case:**\
    Learn how to use the **Multi-Agent Jira** template to connect Prisme.ai agents with Jira for ticket automation and project synchronization.

    **What you’ll see:**

    - Configuring the **Jira API App** with OAuth credentials, project key, and site ID.
    - Running the automation `init_agent` to create a new agent dedicated to Jira operations.
    - Using **AI Knowledge** to store Jira issue types automatically.
    - Inspecting the automation logic that triggers document creation for each issue type.
    - Creating custom tools to interact directly with Jira APIs.
    - Updating automations and verifying synchronization in the activity feed.
    - Chatting with the AI to **create Jira tickets automatically**.
    - Verifying ticket creation in Jira and viewing the automation logs.
    - Understanding **event chaining** between “init agent” → “update knowledge base” → “execute Jira API”.
    - Cleaning or reinitializing knowledge bases with utility automations.

    **Result:**\
    This use case illustrates how AI Builder connects enterprise systems like Jira with generative agents, enabling **multi-agent automation** and secure operational AI at scale.

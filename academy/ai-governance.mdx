AI Governance provides IT and compliance teams with full visibility and control over how AI is used within the enterprise.  
It centralizes access, usage policies, and compliance reporting — ensuring responsible, secure, and auditable AI operations at scale.

## Business Context

As organizations scale their AI adoption, governance becomes a critical foundation.  
AI Governance provides the tools to ensure that every interaction with AI — whether from employees or systems — complies with security, regulatory, and ethical requirements.

It helps enterprises:
- Define policies for LLM access and model selection.  
- Control user permissions and workspace visibility.  
- Monitor usage patterns, quotas, and cost allocation.  
- Track adoption and ensure compliance with audit-ready reporting.

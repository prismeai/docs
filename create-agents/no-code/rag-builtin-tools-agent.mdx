  <Card title="Hybrid Knowledge Approach" icon="database-gear">
    Strategically combine internal knowledge with web information
    
    **Implementation**:
    ```
    For product information:
    - Always use internal knowledge for specifications and features
    - Use web browsing only for competitor comparisons
    - Supplement with internal competitive analysis when available
    - Clearly distinguish between internal and external information
    ```
    
    This approach ensures accurate internal information while benefiting from external context.

## Enterprise Integration Considerations

<Accordion title="Governance and Compliance">
  When deploying RAG + Tools agents in enterprise environments, consider:
  
  - **Usage Policies**: Define clear guidelines for appropriate tool usage
  - **Content Review**: Establish processes for reviewing agent outputs
  - **Audit Trails**: Implement logging for tool usage and information sources
  - **Access Controls**: Limit specific tools to appropriate user groups
  - **Compliance Checks**: Ensure tool outputs meet regulatory requirements
  
  **Implementation Example**:
  ```
  This agent's web browsing capability is restricted to approved domains and automatically logs all external information sources. Image generation follows brand guidelines and content policies. All data processing complies with our data handling procedures and privacy requirements.
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Security Considerations">
  Protect sensitive information when using tools:
  
  - **Data Handling**: Establish clear rules for handling sensitive information
  - **Tool Boundaries**: Define what data can be processed by each tool
  - **Output Scrubbing**: Implement checks for sensitive information in outputs
  - **Authentication**: Manage service credentials securely
  - **User Permissions**: Align tool access with user authorization levels
  
  **Implementation Example**:
  ```
  Code interpreter will not process files containing PII or confidential information. Web browsing is restricted to public information only. All generated content is screened for sensitive information before delivery to users.
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Scalability Planning">
  Prepare for widespread adoption and usage:
  
  - **Resource Management**: Monitor and optimize tool usage patterns
  - **Usage Quotas**: Implement appropriate limits for resource-intensive tools
  - **Caching Strategies**: Cache common tool results when appropriate
  - **Load Balancing**: Distribute tool processing across resources
  - **Performance Monitoring**: Track response times and resource utilization
  
  **Implementation Example**:
  ```
  This agent implements smart caching for web search results and common calculations. Image generation is limited to 10 images per user per day. Resource-intensive code execution has a 60-second timeout with graceful degradation to simpler analysis for complex requests.
  ```

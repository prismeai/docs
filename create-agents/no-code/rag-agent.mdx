# RAG Agents

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) agents combine the reasoning capabilities of foundation models with access to your organization's proprietary knowledge. By retrieving relevant information and incorporating it into responses, RAG agents provide accurate, contextual answers grounded in your specific business documents and data.


## What is Retrieval Augmented Generation?

RAG is an AI architecture that enhances large language models (LLMs) by connecting them to external knowledge sources. This approach allows models to access, retrieve, and integrate specific information that may be:

- Beyond their training data
- Proprietary to your organization
- Frequently updated
- Highly specialized or technical

<Note>
  RAG addresses one of the key limitations of foundation models: their inability to access specific, up-to-date, or proprietary information not included in their training data.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Document Processing Optimization">
  The quality of your knowledge base is foundational to RAG performance.
  
  **Recommendations**:
  
  - **Effective chunking strategy**: Balance chunk size to capture sufficient context while remaining focused
    ```
    # Example chunking configuration
    {
      "chunk_size": 1000,
      "chunk_overlap": 200,
      "chunking_strategy": "semantic_paragraphs"
    }
    ```
  
  - **Quality embedding models**: Use high-dimensional embeddings for better semantic representation
  
  - **Metadata enrichment**: Add metadata to improve filtering and relevance
    ```
    # Example metadata fields
    {
      "document_type": "policy",
      "department": "finance",
      "effective_date": "2023-09-01",
      "policy_number": "FIN-2023-05",
      "audience": ["managers", "finance_team"]
    }
    ```
  
  - **Regular updates**: Establish processes for keeping the knowledge base current
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Retrieval Tuning">
  Balancing recall (finding all relevant information) and precision (avoiding irrelevant information) is critical.
  
  **Recommendations**:
  
  - **Hybrid search approaches**: Combine semantic and keyword search for better results
    ```
    # Example hybrid search configuration
    {
      "semantic_search_weight": 0.7,
      "keyword_search_weight": 0.3,
      "minimum_relevance_score": 0.75,
      "maximum_results": 5
    }
    ```
  
  - **Query reformulation**: Generate multiple query versions to improve retrieval
    ```
    # Example query reformulation
    Original: "How do I reset my password?"
    Reformulations:
    - "password reset procedure"
    - "steps to change forgotten password"
    - "account credential recovery process"
    ```
  
  - **Reranking**: Apply secondary ranking to improve result relevance
  
  - **Context-aware filtering**: Use conversation context to narrow search scope
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Context Assembly">
  How you organize retrieved information significantly impacts response quality.
  
  **Recommendations**:
  
  - **Context format standardization**: Provide retrieved information in a consistent format
    ```
    # Example context format
    DOCUMENT: [Document Title]
    SOURCE: [Source ID or URL]
    DATE: [Publication or Last Updated Date]
    SECTION: [Section Name]
    CONTENT:
    [Retrieved text]
    
    DOCUMENT: [Next Document Title]
    ...
    ```
  
  - **Source prioritization**: Place more relevant or authoritative sources earlier in context
  
  - **Context instructions**: Include explicit instructions for how the model should use the provided information
    ```
    # Example context instructions
    The following information has been retrieved from company documentation. 
    Use this information to answer the user's question. 
    If the information is insufficient, acknowledge the limitations of the provided context.
    Always cite the specific document and section when providing information.
    ```
  
  - **Context window management**: Be strategic about what fits in limited context windows
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Response Generation Guidance">
  Clear instructions improve how models use retrieved information.
  
  **Recommendations**:
  
  - **Source attribution requirements**: Instruct on when and how to cite sources
    ```
    # Example attribution instruction
    Always cite the specific document name and section when providing information from the retrieved context.
    Use the format: "According to [Document Name], section [Section Name], ..."
    ```
  
  - **Information synthesis guidance**: Explain how to combine information from multiple sources
    ```
    # Example synthesis instruction
    If multiple sources provide relevant information, synthesize them into a coherent response.
    If sources conflict, acknowledge the discrepancy and clarify which source is more authoritative or recent.
    ```
  
  - **Handling information gaps**: Provide clear guidance for when retrieved information is insufficient
    ```
    # Example information gap handling
    If the retrieved information doesn't fully answer the user's question:
    1. Provide what information is available
    2. Clearly state what specific aspects cannot be addressed based on the available information
    3. Suggest how the user might find the missing information (e.g., specific documentation to check)
    ```
  
  - **Uncertainty management**: Establish how to handle varying levels of confidence

## Advanced RAG Techniques

Once you've mastered basic RAG implementation, consider these advanced techniques:

<Accordion title="Multi-Stage Retrieval">
  Implement a cascade of retrieval steps to improve both efficiency and accuracy.
  
  **Example Process**:
  ```
  1. Initial broad retrieval: Use embeddings to find potentially relevant documents
  2. Reranking: Apply more sophisticated models to rerank initial results
  3. Focused retrieval: Perform targeted retrieval on the most promising documents
  4. Final assembly: Combine the most relevant information for the model
  ```
  
  This approach is particularly effective for large knowledge bases where a single retrieval step may miss important information or retrieve too much irrelevant content.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Query Enhancement">
  Improve retrieval by transforming user queries into more effective search queries.
  
  **Techniques**:
  - **Query expansion**: Add related terms to improve recall
    ```
    Original: "vacation policy"
    Expanded: "vacation policy time off leave holiday absence"
    ```
  
  - **Hypothetical document embeddings**: Generate embeddings for the ideal documents that would answer the query
  
  - **Query decomposition**: Break complex queries into sub-queries
    ```
    Original: "What's our policy on remote work expenses for international employees?"
    Decomposed:
    - "remote work policy"
    - "expense reimbursement policy"
    - "international employee policies"
    ```
  
  - **Conversational context incorporation**: Include relevant previous exchanges
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Self-Verification and Correction">
  Implement mechanisms for the agent to verify its own responses.
  
  **Approaches**:
  ```
  1. Generate initial response based on retrieved information
  2. Extract factual claims from the response
  3. Verify each claim against the retrieved information
  4. Correct or qualify statements that aren't fully supported
  5. Regenerate improved response
  ```
  
  This process can significantly reduce hallucinations and improve accuracy, particularly for complex or nuanced topics.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Knowledge Graph Integration">
  Enhance RAG with structured knowledge representation.
  
  **Benefits**:
  - Capture relationships between entities
  - Provide structured context for ambiguous terms
  - Enable reasoning across related concepts
  - Improve query understanding through entity resolution
  
  Knowledge graphs can complement text retrieval by providing structured information about entities and their relationships, particularly valuable in domains with complex interconnections like product catalogs, organizational structures, or technical systems.
</Accordion>

# Simple Prompting Agents

Simple prompting agents harness the power of foundation models through carefully crafted instructions, personas, and response formats. While straightforward to implement, these agents can deliver significant value for many business applications when properly designed.

## What is Simple Prompting?

Simple prompting leverages the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by providing them with clear instructions, context, and guidance. Unlike more complex agent architectures, simple prompting doesn't require additional components like knowledge bases or tool integrations.

<Note>
  Simple prompting is sometimes called "prompt engineering" or "instruction tuning" in industry literature.

     - If primarily backup → evaluate security and recovery features
  
  2. Then assess scale requirements:
     - If <10 users → recommend small business tier
     - If 10-100 users → recommend business tier
     - If >100 users → recommend enterprise tier
     
  3. Finally consider technical expertise:
     - If low technical expertise → emphasize ease-of-use and support
     - If medium technical expertise → balance features and usability
     - If high technical expertise → focus on advanced features and customization
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Meta-Prompts">
  Include instructions for how the agent should handle its own limitations or uncertainty.
  
  **Example**:
  ```
  When you're uncertain about a technical detail:
  1. Explicitly acknowledge the limitation: "I want to be careful about providing accurate information here."
  2. Share what you do know with confidence
  3. Indicate the specific area of uncertainty
  4. Suggest how the user might find authoritative information
  
  Example response:
  "I want to be careful about providing accurate information here. The Acme Cloud Platform definitely supports automatic file versioning and retention policies. However, I'm not certain about the specific retention limits in the Enterprise tier. I recommend checking the official documentation at docs.acmecloud.com/retention or contacting your account representative for the most up-to-date information."
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Progressive Disclosure">
  Structure information to present it in digestible layers, from basic to advanced.
  
  **Example**:
  ```
  When explaining technical concepts:
  
  1. Begin with a simple 1-2 sentence explanation accessible to beginners
  2. Follow with practical implications/applications
  3. Then provide more technical details for intermediate users
  4. Finally, include advanced considerations or edge cases for expert users
  
  Always separate these layers visually (with headings or breaks) to allow users to stop at their needed level of detail.
  ```
</Accordion>

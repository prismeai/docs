## Best Practices for No-Code Agents

<Accordion title="Start Simple, Then Expand">
  Begin with basic functionality and add complexity incrementally.
  
  **Approach:**
  - Create a minimal viable agent first
  - Test core functionality thoroughly
  - Add additional capabilities one at a time
  - Validate each new feature before moving on
  
  This iterative approach helps identify issues early and ensures a solid foundation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Craft Clear Instructions">
  The quality of your system instructions directly impacts agent performance.
  
  **Guidelines:**
  - Be specific about the agent's role and purpose
  - Provide examples of ideal responses
  - Include formatting requirements
  - Define boundaries and limitations clearly
  - Use simple, unambiguous language
  
  Well-crafted instructions create consistent, predictable agent behavior and reduce the need for frequent refinements.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Optimize Knowledge Organization">
  How you structure your knowledge bases affects retrieval quality.
  
  **Best practices:**
  - Organize documents logically by topic
  - Use clear, descriptive document titles
  - Break large documents into meaningful chunks
  - Include relevant metadata for filtering
  - Remove duplicate or outdated content
  
  Strategic knowledge organization improves response accuracy and relevance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test with Real Scenarios">
  Validate your agent with authentic use cases and edge cases.
  
  **Testing approach:**
  - Create a diverse set of test questions
  - Include common queries and edge cases
  - Test with different phrasings of similar questions
  - Incorporate actual user language and terminology
  - Validate tool usage with realistic scenarios
  
  Thorough testing identifies gaps and ensures the agent can handle real-world interactions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Collect and Incorporate Feedback">
  Establish a systematic process for gathering and implementing user input.
  
  **Feedback system:**
  - Enable easy feedback submission within the agent interface
  - Review feedback regularly
  - Identify patterns in user satisfaction and pain points
  - Prioritize improvements based on impact
  - Close the feedback loop by informing users of changes
  
  Continuous improvement based on user feedback ensures the agent remains valuable over time.

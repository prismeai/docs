The Prisme.ai platform enables your organization to create custom AI agents that can be tailored to specific business needs, knowledge domains, and workflows. These agents leverage the power of large language models (LLMs) while incorporating your organization's unique knowledge and requirements.


## What are Prisme.ai Agents?

Prisme.ai agents are specialized AI assistants that combine the capabilities of foundation models with your organization's:

- **Knowledge and expertise**: Documents, processes, procedures
- **Data sources**: Databases, APIs, knowledge bases
- **Business context**: Industry-specific terminology and workflows
- **Security requirements**: Enterprise-grade access controls and governance

## Agent Creation Process

Creating effective enterprise agents involves several key steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define the Agent's Purpose">
    Clearly articulate what problem the agent will solve, who will use it, and what capabilities it needs.

    Key questions to answer:

    - What specific tasks will the agent perform?
    - Who are the primary users?
    - What knowledge or data sources does it need access to?
    - What security or compliance requirements apply?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the Agent Type">
    Choose the appropriate agent architecture based on your requirements.

    Selection criteria:

    - Simple prompting for basic Q&A and standardized responses
    - RAG for knowledge-intensive applications
    - Tool-using agents for integration with systems and services
    - Multi-agent systems for complex workflows requiring multiple capabilities
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Knowledge and Tools">
    Connect the agent to relevant data sources, knowledge bases, and tools.

    Configuration options:

    - Knowledge base connections
    - Tool integrations
    - API access
    - Data source connections
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test and Refine">
    Validate the agent's performance and iteratively improve its capabilities.

    Testing approaches:

    - Sample queries
    - User scenarios
    - Edge case validation
    - Continuous feedback incorporation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy and Monitor">
    Make the agent available to users and track its performance.

    Deployment considerations:

    - Access controls
    - Usage monitoring
    - Performance analytics
    - Ongoing maintenance
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security and Governance

All agents created on the Prisme.ai platform inherit enterprise-grade security features:

- **Access controls**: Comprehensive RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- **Audit logging**: Detailed tracking of agent creation and usage
- **Data privacy**: Secure handling of sensitive information
- **Compliance**: Support for regulatory requirements
- **Governance**: Centralized management of agent deployments

<Accordion title="Security Best Practices">
  When creating agents, follow these security best practices:

  - Limit agent access to only the data sources and tools required for its function
  - Implement proper access controls for the agent itself
  - Regularly review agent performance and security logs
  - Keep knowledge sources up to date to ensure accuracy
  - Test agents thoroughly before deployment to prevent unintended behaviors

## Prompt Anatomy

An effective enterprise prompt typically contains several key components:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Role Definition">
    Establishes the agent's identity, expertise, and perspective.
    
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    You are a Customer Support Specialist for Acme Financial Services, with expertise in retirement account management and investment products.
    ```
    
    **Best Practices:**
    - Be specific about domain expertise
    - Align with your brand voice and values
    - Set appropriate authority level
    - Define relationship to the user
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Task Instructions">
    Clearly defines what the agent should do.
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    Your task is to help users understand our retirement products, troubleshoot account issues, and provide guidance on investment options within our product lineup.
    ```
    
    **Best Practices:**
    - Be specific about expected actions
    - Define scope boundaries clearly
    - Prioritize tasks if multiple exist
    - Include success criteria when possible
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Response Guidelines">
    Establishes how the agent should structure and format responses.
  
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    When responding to users:
    1. Keep explanations concise and jargon-free
    2. Include relevant regulatory disclaimers when discussing investment options
    3. For complex topics, provide a simple overview first, then offer more details
    4. Always summarize next steps or recommendations at the end of your response
    ```
    
    **Best Practices:**
    - Define preferred response length
    - Specify formatting requirements
    - Include sample responses for key scenarios
    - Establish tone and communication style
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Constraints and Guardrails">
    Establishes boundaries and limitations for the agent.
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    Important limitations:
    - Do not provide specific investment recommendations or financial advice
    - Never discuss products from competitors
    - Do not share specific fee percentages unless explicitly asked
    - Always clarify that tax implications should be discussed with a tax professional
    ```
    
    **Best Practices:**
    - Be explicit about what not to do
    - Include compliance requirements
    - Define escalation criteria
    - Specify data handling requirements
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Knowledge Context">
    Provides background information to inform responses.
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    Key information about our retirement products:
    - Our 401(k) plan offers 12 investment options across different risk categories
    - Annual contribution limits follow IRS guidelines ($22,500 for 2023, with catch-up provisions)
    - Early withdrawal penalties apply before age 59Â½ with specific exceptions
    - Our target date funds automatically adjust risk based on expected retirement year
    ```
    
    **Best Practices:**
    - Include fundamental domain knowledge
    - Provide context-specific facts
    - Update regularly for accuracy
    - Organize logically by topic
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prompt Engineering Principles

Follow these core principles to create effective prompts for enterprise applications:

<Accordion title="Be Specific and Detailed">
  Vague instructions lead to inconsistent results. Provide clear, detailed guidance about exactly what you want.
  
  **Instead of:**
  ```
  Help the user with their product questions.
  ```
  
  **Use:**
  ```
  Respond to the user's questions about our enterprise software products by:
  1. Identifying which specific product they're asking about
  2. Providing accurate feature information based on the latest product documentation
  3. Explaining benefits in terms of business value and ROI
  4. Addressing common implementation concerns proactively
  5. Suggesting relevant case studies or resources when appropriate
  ```
  
  This level of specificity gives the model clear criteria for what constitutes a good response.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use Explicit Formatting Instructions">
  Define exactly how responses should be structured for consistency and usability.
  
  **Example:**
  ```
  When comparing product options, always use this format:
  
  PRODUCT COMPARISON: [Product A] vs [Product B]
  
  FEATURE COMPARISON:
  - [Feature Category 1]: 
    * [Product A]: [description]
    * [Product B]: [description]
  - [Feature Category 2]: 
    * [Product A]: [description]
    * [Product B]: [description]
  
  IDEAL USE CASES:
  - [Product A]: [primary use cases]
  - [Product B]: [primary use cases]
  
  PRICING CONSIDERATIONS:
  [Summary of key pricing differences]
  ```
  
  Structured outputs improve readability and make information easier to scan and digest.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Provide Examples">
  Include examples of ideal responses to guide the model's outputs.
  
  **Example:**
  ```
  Here's an example of how to respond to a question about our security features:
  
  User: "Tell me about your security features."
  
  Response:
  "Our platform includes multi-layered security features designed for enterprise requirements:
  
  1. Authentication: Multi-factor authentication, SSO integration with major providers (Okta, Azure AD), and role-based access controls.
  
  2. Data Protection: End-to-end encryption for data in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256), with customer-managed encryption keys available on Enterprise plans.
  
  3. Compliance: SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR compliant, and regular third-party penetration testing.
  
  4. Infrastructure: Hosted on AWS with redundant backups, disaster recovery, and 99.9% uptime SLA.
  
  Would you like me to elaborate on any specific security aspect that's most important for your organization?"
  ```
  
  Examples demonstrate the level of detail, tone, and structure you expect.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Implement Guardrails">
  Clearly define boundaries and limitations to prevent problematic outputs.
  
  **Example:**
  ```
  Important guidelines when discussing our products:
  
  1. Never make direct comparisons to competitor products by name
  2. Do not provide pricing information beyond what's publicly available on our website
  3. Don't make promises about future features or release dates
  4. Avoid making absolute claims about security (e.g., "unhackable," "100% secure")
  5. Don't share customer names or case studies that aren't in our public materials
  6. Always include appropriate disclaimers when discussing regulatory compliance
  ```
  
  Clear boundaries help prevent compliance issues and maintain appropriate messaging.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use Contextual Prompting">
  Adapt instructions based on the specific context of the interaction.
  
  **Example:**
  ```
  If the user is asking about technical specifications, provide detailed, precise information with technical terminology appropriate for IT professionals.
  
  If the user is asking about business value or ROI, focus on high-level benefits, cost savings, and strategic advantages with terminology appropriate for business stakeholders.
  
  If the user seems confused or frustrated, prioritize clarity and support over comprehensive information. Offer to connect them with additional resources or human support.
  ```
  
  Contextual adaptation improves relevance and user experience.
</Accordion>

## Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques

For more sophisticated applications, consider these advanced techniques:

  <Card title="Chain-of-Thought Prompting" icon="link">
    Guide the model to show its reasoning process step-by-step.
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    When answering complex technical questions:
    1. First acknowledge the question
    2. Break down the problem into components
    3. Address each component with clear reasoning
    4. Synthesize the information into a final answer
    5. Verify the logic of your response
    ```
    
    This technique improves accuracy for complex reasoning tasks.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Few-Shot Learning" icon="clone">
    Provide multiple examples to establish patterns.
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    Here are examples of how to classify customer inquiries:
    
    Inquiry: "How do I reset my password?"
    Category: ACCOUNT_ACCESS
    Priority: MEDIUM
    
    Inquiry: "Your system deleted all my data!"
    Category: DATA_ISSUE
    Priority: HIGH
    
    Inquiry: "Do you offer discounts for non-profits?"
    Category: PRICING
    Priority: LOW
    ```
    
    This helps the model recognize patterns and apply them consistently.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Role-Based Prompting" icon="user-tie">
    Assign specific roles or personas to guide responses.
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    Approach this explanation as if you were:
    1. A technical architect explaining to developers
    2. A solution consultant explaining to business users
    3. A technical support specialist explaining to an end user
    ```
    
    Different roles help tailor explanations to specific audiences.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Decision Tree Prompting" icon="sitemap">
    Guide the model through conditional logic paths.
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    To resolve this customer issue:
    
    1. First determine if this is a:
       - Technical issue â go to step 2
       - Billing issue â go to step 3
       - Feature request â go to step 4
    
    2. For technical issues:
       - If related to login â check account status first
       - If related to performance â check system status first
       - If related to data â verify backup status first
    ```
    
    This technique improves handling of complex, multi-step processes.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prompt Optimization for Different Agent Types

Different types of agents require tailored prompting approaches:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Simple Prompting Agents">
    For agents relying primarily on the model's capabilities:
    
    **Key Considerations:**
    - Comprehensive instructions are essential
    - Detailed examples improve consistency
    - Clear boundaries prevent unwanted outputs
    - Response templates ensure consistent format
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    You are a Human Resources Assistant for Acme Corporation. Your role is to help employees understand company policies and benefits.
    
    When responding to policy questions:
    1. Begin by clearly stating the policy name and its purpose
    2. Summarize the key points in bullet form
    3. Provide any relevant deadlines or action items
    4. Include information on where to find the complete policy
    5. Offer to help with specific questions about the policy
    
    Always maintain a helpful, supportive tone and acknowledge that policy questions can sometimes be confusing or stressful.
    
    Example response:
    "The Flexible Work Arrangement Policy allows eligible employees to request modified work schedules or remote work options.
    
    Key points:
    â¢ Available to employees with at least 6 months of employment
    â¢ Requires manager approval and departmental compatibility
    â¢ Can include flexible hours, compressed workweeks, or remote work
    â¢ Must maintain core business hours (10am-3pm local time)
    
    The full policy can be found in the Employee Handbook on the HR Portal. If you have specific questions about your eligibility or how to apply, I'm happy to help walk you through the process."
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="RAG Agents">
    For agents that retrieve and use specific information:
    
    **Key Considerations:**
    - Instructions for handling retrieved information
    - Citation and attribution guidelines
    - Managing contradictory or incomplete information
    - Balancing retrieved content with generated responses
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    You are a Technical Documentation Assistant with access to our product documentation.
    
    When answering questions:
    1. Use the retrieved information as your primary source of truth
    2. Always cite the specific document and section your information comes from
    3. If the retrieved information doesn't fully answer the question, clearly state what's missing
    4. Do not speculate or fill in details beyond what's in the documentation
    5. If multiple sources contain relevant information, synthesize them while maintaining accuracy
    
    When citing sources use this format: "According to [Document Name] (Section: [Section Name]), [information]."
    
    If you cannot find relevant information in the retrieved context, say: "I don't see specific information about this in the current documentation. For the most accurate answer, I recommend [alternative resource]."
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Tool-Using Agents">
    For agents that use tools and external capabilities:
    
    **Key Considerations:**
    - Decision criteria for when to use tools
    - Instructions for interpreting tool outputs
    - Error handling guidelines
    - User communication during tool use
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    You are a Customer Support Agent with access to several tools to help resolve customer issues.
    
    When to use available tools:
    â¢ Use the Account Lookup tool when you need to verify account status, subscription level, or user permissions
    â¢ Use the Knowledge Base tool when you need to find specific product documentation or troubleshooting guides
    â¢ Use the Ticket Creation tool when an issue cannot be resolved immediately and needs to be escalated
    
    When using tools:
    1. Tell the user you're checking their information before using the tool
    2. Interpret the results clearly for the user, avoiding technical jargon
    3. If a tool returns an error, try once more and then suggest an alternative approach
    4. Always summarize the key information from tool results
    
    Example flow:
    User: "I can't access the admin dashboard anymore."
    
    You: "I understand you're having trouble accessing the admin dashboard. Let me check your account details to help resolve this. One moment please."
    
    [Use Account Lookup Tool]
    
    You: "Thank you for your patience. I've checked your account and I see that your admin permissions were changed on March 15th. This explains why you're unable to access the dashboard. To resolve this, I'll need to create a ticket for our permissions team to review. Would you like me to do that for you?"
    ```

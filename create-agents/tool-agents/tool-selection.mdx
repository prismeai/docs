<Note>
  These guides provide example YAML files for educational purposes, showcasing the range of possibilities. It is up to the technical teams to implement them according to your internal tools and APIs.
</Note>

## Understanding Tool Selection

Tool selection is the process by which an AI agent:

1. **Recognizes** when a tool is needed to fulfill a user request
2. **Evaluates** which available tool is most appropriate
3. **Prepares** the necessary parameters for tool execution
4. **Decides** whether to use the tool results or try alternative approaches

<Note>
  Effective tool selection balances accuracy (choosing the right tool) with efficiency (minimizing unnecessary tool usage).

## Tool Selection Strategies

Prisme.ai supports several approaches to tool selection, each with different strengths:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="LLM-Based Selection">
    Leverage the language model's reasoning to select appropriate tools.

    **How it works**:

    - Tools are described to the LLM with clear purposes and capabilities
    - The LLM analyzes user requests and determines tool requirements
    - Function calling capabilities enable structured tool invocation
    - The LLM formats parameters based on tool schemas

    **Best for**:

    - General-purpose agents with diverse tools
    - Complex decision-making with nuanced criteria
    - Adapting to varied user request formulations
    - Scenarios where selection logic is difficult to formalize
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Rule-Based Selection">
    Implement explicit rules and conditions for tool selection.

    **How it works**:

    - Predetermined conditions dictate when specific tools are used
    - Pattern matching identifies relevant request types
    - Decision trees guide the selection process
    - Explicit fallback strategies handle edge cases

    **Best for**:

    - Well-defined, predictable use cases
    - High-reliability requirements
    - Performance-critical applications
    - Compliance-sensitive contexts
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Hybrid Approach">
    Combine LLM reasoning with rule-based guardrails.

    **How it works**:

    - Rules provide boundaries and constraints
    - LLM makes decisions within allowed parameters
    - Explicit overrides for special cases
    - Validation of LLM selections against business rules

    **Best for**:

    - Complex environments with some well-defined constraints
    - Balancing flexibility with control
    - Evolving systems where rules are being refined
    - Enterprise environments with governance requirements
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Implementing LLM-Based Selection

For many applications, LLM-based selection provides the best balance of flexibility and effectiveness:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Craft Clear Tool Descriptions">
    Provide the LLM with detailed information about each tool.

    **Effective description elements**:

    ```yaml
    name: CustomerLookup
    description: |
      Use this tool to find customer information in the CRM system.
      This tool should be used when the user asks about specific customer details,
      account status, or purchase history.
      Do NOT use this tool for general product inquiries or non-customer-specific questions.
      The tool requires either a customer ID or an email address to perform the lookup.
    ```

    Key components include:

    - Clear purpose statement
    - When to use the tool
    - When NOT to use the tool
    - Required parameters
    - Expected outcomes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide Selection Guidelines">
    Include explicit guidance for tool selection in your agent instructions.

    **Example guidelines**:

    ```
    When choosing between available tools:
    
    1. Always use the most specific tool for the task
    2. Prefer internal data sources over external ones when both contain the information
    3. Use the ProductSearch tool for general product inquiries and ProductDetails for specific product information
    4. Only use the CustomerUpdate tool when explicitly asked to change customer information
    5. If multiple tools could work, explain your selection reasoning to the user
    ```

    These guidelines help the LLM make consistent decisions aligned with business preferences.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Parameter Extraction">
    Guide the LLM in extracting and formatting parameters from user requests.

    **Example guidance**:

    ```
    When extracting parameters for tools:
    
    1. For customer lookups, identify any customer ID (format: CUS-XXXXX) or email address
    2. For product searches, extract product type, category, price range, and features
    3. For date ranges, convert relative dates (e.g., "last week") to specific date formats
    4. Always confirm ambiguous parameters with the user before tool execution
    5. Format numeric parameters according to each tool's requirements
    ```

    Effective parameter extraction ensures tools receive correctly formatted inputs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Design Error Recovery">
    Prepare for tool selection errors with recovery strategies.

    **Example recovery instructions**:

    ```
    If a tool returns an error or no results:
    
    1. First, check if parameters were correctly formatted and try again with adjustments
    2. If parameters are correct but no results found, try an alternative tool if available
    3. For customer lookups that fail, try searching by alternate identifiers
    4. If all tool attempts fail, explain to the user what was tried and ask for additional information
    5. Never make up information if tools cannot retrieve it
    ```

    These strategies ensure resilience when initial tool selections don't succeed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: LLM-Based Tool Selection

Here's a complete example of custom implementation of LLM-based tool selection:

```yaml
slug: llm-tool-selection
name: "LLM-Based Tool Selection"
description: "Uses the LLM to select appropriate tools based on user input"
do:
  - AgentAnalyzer.chat-completion:
      prompt: |
        Select the most appropriate tool for this user request:
        User request: "{{input.text}}"

        Available tools:
        1. WeatherTool - Gets current weather information for a location
        2. CalendarTool - Manages calendar events and appointments
        3. StockTool - Retrieves current stock prices and market information
        
        Respond with a JSON object containing:
        - selectedTool: name of the selected tool
        - reasoning: why this tool was selected
        - parameters: parameters to pass to the tool
      output: toolSelection
  
  - conditions:
      '{{toolSelection.selectedTool}} == "WeatherTool"':
        - WeatherTool.execute:
            location: "{{toolSelection.parameters.location}}"
            output: result
      '{{toolSelection.selectedTool}} == "CalendarTool"':
        - CalendarTool.execute:
            action: "{{toolSelection.parameters.action}}"
            date: "{{toolSelection.parameters.date}}"
            output: result
      '{{toolSelection.selectedTool}} == "StockTool"':
        - StockTool.execute:
            symbol: "{{toolSelection.parameters.symbol}}"
            output: result
      default:
        - set:
            name: result
            value:
              error: "No appropriate tool selected"

output: "{{result}}"
when:
  events:
    - user-request
```

## Implementing Rule-Based Selection

For more controlled environments, rule-based selection provides predictability and reliability:

<Accordion title="Pattern-Based Routing">
  Implement explicit patterns that map user requests to specific tools.

  **Example implementation**:

  ```yaml
  slug: rule-based-tool-selection
  name: "Rule-Based Tool Selection"
  description: "Uses explicit rules to determine which tool to use"
  do:
    - EntityExtractor.extract:
        text: "{{input.text}}"
        output: entities
    - set:
        name: selectedTool
        value: "None"
   
    - conditions:
        '{{input.text}} matches "weather" && {{entities.locations.length}} > 0':
          - set:
              name: selectedTool
              value: "WeatherTool"
          - set:
              name: toolParameters
              value:
                location: "{{entities.locations[0]}}"
  
    - conditions:
        '{{input.text}} matches "schedule" && {{entities.dates.length}} > 0':
          - set:
              name: selectedTool
              value: "CalendarTool"
          - set:
              name: toolParameters
              value:
                action: "{{entities.action}}"
  			  date: "{{entities.dates[0]}}"
    
    - conditions:
        '{{input.text}} matches "stock" && {{entities.companies.length}} > 0':
          - set:
              name: selectedTool
              value: "StockTool"
          - set:
              name: toolParameters
              value:
                symbol: "{{entities.companies[0].symbol}}"  
    - conditions:
        '{{selectedTool}} == "WeatherTool"':
          - WeatherTool.execute:
              location: "{{toolParameters.location}}"
              output: result
        '{{selectedTool}} == "CalendarTool"':
          - CalendarTool.execute:
              action: "{{toolParameters.action}}"
              date: "{{toolParameters.date}}"
              output: result
        '{{selectedTool}} == "StockTool"':
          - StockTool.execute:
              symbol: "{{toolParameters.symbol}}"
              output: result
        default:
          - set:
              name: result
              value:
                message: "I couldn't determine which tool would help with your request."
  
  output: "{{result}}"
  when:
    events:
      - user-request
  ```

  This approach:

  - Uses pattern matching on user input text
  - Extracts and validates required entities
  - Maps patterns to specific tool selections
  - Provides a clear fallback for unrecognized patterns
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Intent-Based Routing">
  Use intent classification to determine appropriate tools.

  **Example implementation**:

  ```yaml
  do:
    - IntentClassifier.classify:
        input: '{{input.text}}'
        output: intent
    - conditions:
        '{{intent.primary}} == "get_account_balance"':
          - AccountBalance.execute:
              input: '{{input.text}}'
              output: toolResult
        '{{intent.primary}} == "transfer_funds"':
          - FundsTransfer.execute:
              input: '{{input.text}}'
              output: toolResult
        '{{intent.primary}} == "report_fraud"':
          - FraudReport.execute:
              input: '{{input.text}}'
              output: toolResult
        default:
          - conditions:
              '{{intent.confidence}} < 0.7':
                - IntentClarification.execute:
                    input: '{{input.text}}'
                    intent: '{{intent}}'
                    output: toolResult
              default:
                - GeneralAssistant.execute:
                    input: '{{input.text}}'
                    output: toolResult
  ```

  This approach:

  - Uses a dedicated intent classification model
  - Routes requests based on classified intent
  - Considers confidence scores in decision-making
  - Includes clarification flows for low-confidence cases
</Accordion>

## Example: Hybrid Selection Approach

Most enterprise applications benefit from hybrid approaches that combine LLM flexibility with rule-based governance:

```yaml
slug: hybrid-tool-selection
name: "Hybrid Tool Selection"
description: "Combines rule-based filtering with LLM ranking for optimal tool selection"
do:
  - EntityExtractor.extract:
      text: "{{input.text}}"
      output: entities
  - set:
      name: eligibleTools
      value: []
  
  - conditions:
      '{{input.text}} matches "weather" && {{entities.locations.length}} > 0':
        - set:
            name: eligibleTools[]
            value:
              name: "WeatherTool"
              parameters:
                location: "{{entities.locations[0]}}"
  
  - conditions:
      '{{input.text}} matches "schedule" && {{entities.dates.length}} > 0':
        - set:
            name: eligibleTools[]
            value:
              name: "CalendarTool"
              parameters:

            value:
              name: "StockTool"
              parameters:
                symbol: "{{entities.companies[0].symbol}}"
  
  - conditions:
      '{{eligibleTools.length}} > 1':
        - Knowledge Client.chat-completion:
            prompt: |
              Rank these tools for the user request: "{{input.text}}"
              
              Available tools:
              {{eligibleTools}}
              - {{tool.name}}              
                Respond with a JSON array of tool names, ranked from most to least appropriate.
            output: rankedTools
        - set:
            name: selectedTool
            value: "{{rankedTools[0]}}"
      '{{eligibleTools.length}} == 1':
        - set:
            name: selectedTool
            value: "{{eligibleTools[0].name}}"
        - set:
            name: toolParameters
            value: "{{eligibleTools[0].parameters}}"
      default:
        - Knowledge Client.chat-completion:
            prompt: |
              Select the most appropriate tool for this user request:
              User request: "{{input.text}}"
              
              Available tools:
              1. WeatherTool - Gets current weather information for a location
              2. CalendarTool - Manages calendar events and appointments

              Respond with a JSON object containing:
              - selectedTool: name of the selected tool
              - parameters: parameters to pass to the tool
            output: llmSelection
        - set:
            name: selectedTool
            value: "{{llmSelection.selectedTool}}"
        - set:
            name: toolParameters
            value: "{{llmSelection.parameters}}"
 
  - conditions:
      '{{selectedTool}} == "WeatherTool"':
        - WeatherTool.execute:

              message: "I couldn't determine which tool would help with your request."

output: "{{result}}"
when:
  events:
    - user-request
```

## Example: Tool Definition

Here's an example of how to define a weather tool in AI Builder:

```yaml
slug: get-weather
name: "Get Weather Information"
description: "Returns current weather information for a specified location"
do:
  - fetch:
      url: "https://api.weatherservice.com/v1/current"
      method: GET
      headers:
        Authorization: "Bearer {{secret.weatherApiKey}}"
      query:
        location: "{{location}}"
      output: weatherData
  - set:
      name: output
      value:
        temperature: "{{weatherData.current.temperature}}"
        condition: "{{weatherData.current.condition.text}}"
        humidity: "{{weatherData.current.humidity}}"
        location: "{{weatherData.location.name}}, {{weatherData.location.country}}"
        updated: "{{weatherData.current.last_updated}}"

validateArguments: true
arguments:
  location:
    type: string
    description: "The city or location to get weather for"
  format:
    type: string
    enum: 
     - detailed
     - simple
    default: simple
    description: "Level of detail to return"
output: "{{output}}"
when:
  endpoint: true
labels:
  - weather
  - tools
```

## Best Practices for Tool Selection

<Accordion title="Balance Precision and Recall">
  Optimize selection logic to balance false positives and false negatives.

  **Recommendations**:

  - Evaluate both incorrect tool selections (false positives)
  - And missed opportunities to use tools (false negatives)
  - Track and analyze selection accuracy metrics
  - Iterate on selection logic based on real usage patterns

  **Implementation example**:

  ```yaml
  # Confidence thresholds for tool selection
  toolSelectionThresholds:
    # High-impact tools (e.g., making purchases, updating records)
    highImpact: 0.85
    # Medium-impact tools (e.g., retrieving information)
    mediumImpact: 0.75
    # Low-impact tools (e.g., informational lookups)
    lowImpact: 0.65
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Provide Selection Transparency">
  Make tool selection reasoning visible to users when appropriate.

  **Recommendations**:

  - Explain which tool was selected and why
  - Indicate when the agent is using external systems
  - Show progress during tool execution
  - Provide context for tool results

  **Example agent response**:

  ```
  I'll check our product inventory system to find that information for you.
  
  [Checking inventory...]
  
  Based on our inventory system, the XPS 15 laptop is currently in stock at 3 locations:
  - Downtown Store: 5 units
  - Westside Mall: 2 units
  - Online Warehouse: 15 units
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Implement Progressive Tool Access">
  Start with limited tool access and expand based on need and performance.

  **Recommendations**:

  - Begin with core, high-reliability tools
  - Add tools incrementally as selection logic matures
  - Implement usage limits for new or sensitive tools
  - Monitor performance before expanding capabilities

  **Implementation approach**:

  ```yaml
  # Tool tiers with progressive access
  toolTiers:
    tier1: # Core tools available to all agents
      - ProductSearch
      - FAQlookup
    tier2: # Added after baseline performance validation
      - CustomerLookup
      - OrderStatus
    tier3: # Limited to specific use cases with approval
      - PaymentProcessing
      - AccountUpdate
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Continuous Improvement">
  Use actual usage data to refine selection logic over time.

  **Recommendations**:

  - Implement usage logging for selection decisions
  - Analyze patterns in successful and unsuccessful selections
  - Identify common error cases and add specific handling
  - Periodically review and update selection criteria

  **Monitoring focus areas**:

  - Tool selection accuracy
  - Tool usage distribution
  - User satisfaction with tool results
  - Error rates and types
  - Response time impacts
</Accordion>

## Tool Selection in AI Knowledge

For AI Knowledge agents, implement effective tool selection through these configurations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Tool Descriptions">
    Create detailed, LLM-friendly descriptions for each tool.

    Effective descriptions include:

    - Clear purpose and capabilities
    - When to use and when not to use
    - Example scenarios
    - Required parameter information
    - Expected result formats
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Tool Selection Instructions">
    Add specific guidance for tool selection in agent instructions.

    Example instructions:

    ```
    Available Tools:
    
    1. Web Browsing: Use when the user needs current information not in our knowledge base. Only use for factual information that would be publicly available.
    
    2. Customer Database: Use when the user asks about specific customer records. Requires a customer ID or email address. Never use for general inquiries.
    
    3. Product Catalog: Use when the user needs detailed product specifications or inventory information. Prefer this over Web Browsing for any product-related queries.
    
    When choosing tools:
    - First check if the information is available in our knowledge base
    - Only use Web Browsing for current events or information that changes frequently
    - Always use the most specific tool for the task
    - If multiple tools could work, explain your choice to the user
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Usage Examples">
    Provide concrete examples of correct tool selection.

    Example:

    ```
    Example 1:
    User: "What's the current price of the XPS 15 laptop?"
    Appropriate tool: Product Catalog
    Reasoning: This is a specific product query about current pricing, which is exactly what the Product Catalog tool is designed for.
    
    Example 2:
    User: "Did we release any new products this month?"
    Appropriate tool: Knowledge Base first, then Product Catalog
    Reasoning: Check our knowledge base first for recent product announcements. If not found or if the information might be outdated, use the Product Catalog to check for products with recent release dates.
    
    Example 3:
    User: "What were the key announcements at yesterday's tech conference?"
    Appropriate tool: Web Browsing
    Reasoning: This is about a recent external event, so the information is likely not in our knowledge base and requires current web information.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test and Refine">
    Evaluate tool selection performance with real-world scenarios.

    Testing approaches:

    - Create a test set of diverse queries
    - Evaluate tool selection accuracy
    - Identify patterns in incorrect selections
    - Refine descriptions and instructions
    - A/B test different instruction formats
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tool Selection in AI Builder

For advanced tool selection logic in AI Builder, implement these patterns:

<Accordion title="Intent-Based Selection">
  Use a dedicated intent classification system for routing.

  **Example implementation**:

  ```yaml
  slug: intent-based-tool-selection
  do:
    - MyApp.classify:
        input: '{{event.data.text}}'
        classes:

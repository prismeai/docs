description: "Learn how to implement effective memory and state management for tool-using agents to maintain context across interactions"
---

Effective memory management enables tool-using agents to maintain context, remember previous interactions, and execute multi-step processes. This guide explores strategies and techniques for implementing robust memory systems in Prisme.ai agents.

## Understanding Agent Memory

Memory in tool-using agents refers to the agent's ability to:

1. **Retain information** from previous interactions
2. **Maintain state** during multi-step processes
3. **Access historical context** to inform current decisions
4. **Track tool usage** results for continuity
5. **Persist user preferences** and settings

<Note>
  Effective memory management creates a coherent, continuous experience across multiple interactions, enabling complex workflows that span multiple turns of conversation.
</Note>

## Types of Agent Memory

Tool-using agents typically require several types of memory:

## Memory Implementation in Prisme.ai

Prisme.ai provides several mechanisms for implementing memory in tool-using agents:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="LLM Context Window">
    Use the model's context window for short-term memory.

    **How it works**:

    - Recent conversation history is included in prompts
    - The LLM maintains continuity based on this history
    - Tool results are appended to the conversation
    - The context window serves as working memory

    **Best for**:

    - Short-term memory needs
    - Simple conversation continuity
    - Limited interaction complexity
    - Minimal state requirements

    **Limitations**:

    - Bounded by context window size
    - Limited persistence
    - No structured state management
    - Potential for information loss as history grows
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Conversation State">
    Maintain structured state in conversation sessions.

    **How it works**:

    - Dedicated state object persists throughout a conversation
    - State is updated with each interaction
    - Structured data can be stored and retrieved
    - State informs tool selection and execution

    **Best for**:

    - Single-session interactions
    - Tracking progress within a conversation
    - Maintaining conversation-specific context
    - Session-level user preferences

    **Limitations**:

    - Typically limited to current session
    - May have storage constraints
    - Usually scoped to one conversation
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Database Persistence">
    Store information in databases for long-term memory.

    **How it works**:

    - Information is stored in structured databases
    - Persistent across sessions and conversations
    - Queryable with specific retrieval patterns
    - Can store large volumes of historical data

    **Best for**:

    - Long-term user profiles
    - Cross-session continuity
    - Complex state management
    - Structured information storage

    **Limitations**:

    - Higher implementation complexity
    - Potential performance impacts
    - Requires careful schema design
    - Security and privacy considerations
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Event History">
    Use Prisme.ai's event system for memory through events.

    **How it works**:

    - Events are logged during agent interactions
    - Event history can be queried for context
    - Event data includes tool usage, results, and user inputs
    - Activity logs provide a comprehensive record

    **Best for**:

    - Debugging and troubleshooting
    - Audit trails and compliance
    - Analyzing interaction patterns
    - Technical diagnostics

    **Limitations**:

    - Not optimized for real-time lookups
    - Primarily designed for technical users
    - Can contain excess information
    - May require filtering for relevance
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices for Memory Management

<CardGroup cols="2">
  <Card title="Right-Size Memory Storage" icon="database">
    Match memory persistence to information importance:

    - Short-term context: Keep in context window
    - Session state: Store in conversation memory
    - User information: Maintain in persistent profiles
    - Configuration data: Store in system settings
  </Card>
  <Card title="Implement Memory Privacy" icon="shield-halved">
    Protect sensitive information in memory systems:

    - Implement appropriate data retention policies
    - Provide clear mechanisms for users to clear history
    - Avoid storing unnecessary sensitive information
    - Apply proper access controls to memory stores
  </Card>
  <Card title="Optimize Context Selection" icon="filter">
    Be selective about what goes into the LLM context:

    - Prioritize recent and relevant messages
    - Include tool results that inform current queries
    - Add active workflow state for ongoing processes
    - Consider user expertise level and preferences
  </Card>
  <Card title="Implement Intelligent Forgetting" icon="trash">
    Design appropriate memory decay mechanisms:

    - Archive or summarize older conversations
    - Gradually reduce detail level of historical information
    - Implement tiered storage with different retention periods

## Memory Management in AI Knowledge

For AI Knowledge agents, configure memory effectively through these approaches:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Conversation History">
    Set appropriate history retention in AI Knowledge.

    Key settings include:

    - Message retention count
    - Context window utilization
    - Token budget allocation
    - History formatting preferences
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Memory Instructions">
    Add specific memory-related guidance in agent instructions.

    Example instructions:

    ```
    Memory Usage Guidelines:
    
    1. Maintain continuity by referencing previous parts of our conversation when relevant
    
    2. If the user refers to something mentioned earlier, acknowledge that you remember it
    
    3. For multi-step processes, keep track of what steps have been completed and what remains
    
    4. When using tools multiple times, remember previous tool results if they remain relevant
    
    5. If you need information that was previously discussed but may no longer be in context, politely ask the user to confirm or repeat it
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Tool Memory">
    Set up how tool results are stored and referenced.

    Key configuration elements:

    - Tool result retention settings
    - Result format in conversation history
    - Integration with subsequent prompts
    - Tool state persistence options
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Memory Effectiveness">
    Verify memory management with multi-turn scenarios.

    Testing should include:

    - References to previous information
    - Multi-step processes spanning several turns
    - Tool usage with result referencing
    - Edge cases like very long conversations
  </Step>
</Steps>

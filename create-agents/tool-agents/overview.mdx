description: "Learn how to create powerful AI agents that can interact with external systems, access APIs, and execute complex workflows through tool integration"
---

Tool-using agents extend beyond conversation and knowledge retrieval by connecting AI capabilities to external systems, databases, and services. These agents can perform actions in the real world, access live data, and execute complex workflows, turning AI from a passive information source into an active participant in your business processes.

## What Are Tool-Using Agents?

Tool-using agents combine the language understanding and generation capabilities of AI models with the ability to:

1. **Determine when to use tools** based on user requests and context
2. **Select appropriate tools** from a set of available capabilities
3. **Format tool parameters** correctly for successful execution
4. **Interpret tool results** and incorporate them into responses
5. **Manage sequences of tool use** for multi-step workflows

<Note>
  Tools represent the bridge between AI language capabilities and functional business systems. They transform agents from conversational interfaces into operational participants in your workflows.
</Note>

## Architecture of Tool-Using Agents

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### How Tool-Using Agents Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request Understanding">
    The agent analyzes the user request to determine intent and required actions.

    During this phase, the agent:

    - Identifies the user's core needs and intent
    - Determines whether tools are required
    - Extracts relevant information for potential tool use
    - Plans a response strategy
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tool Selection">
    If tools are needed, the agent selects the most appropriate tool(s) for the task.

    Selection criteria include:

    - Tool capabilities compared to task requirements
    - Parameter availability from user input
    - Tool reliability and performance characteristics
    - Authorization and access rights
  </Step>
  <Step title="Parameter Preparation">
    The agent formats the necessary parameters for tool execution.

    This process involves:

    - Extracting explicit parameters from user input
    - Inferring implicit parameters based on context
    - Formatting parameters according to tool requirements
    - Validating parameters before submission
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tool Execution">
    The selected tool runs with the prepared parameters.

    During execution:

    - The system handles authentication and authorization
    - The request is sent to the appropriate endpoint
    - Execution is monitored for timeouts or errors
    - Results or errors are captured for further processing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Result Interpretation">
    The agent processes the tool outputs into a usable form.

    This includes:

    - Parsing structured data from tool responses
    - Extracting relevant information for the user's request
    - Handling error cases appropriately
    - Determining if additional tool calls are needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Response Generation">
    Finally, the agent creates a response incorporating tool results.

    The response typically:

    - Presents tool outputs in a user-friendly format
    - Provides context and interpretation of results
    - Maintains conversation continuity
    - Suggests next steps or additional actions
  </Step>
</Steps>

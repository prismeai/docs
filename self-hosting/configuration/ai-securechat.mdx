# Creating a SecureChat Agent

SecureChat is not a standalone product, but a **type of intelligent agent** that can be created and configured within Prisme.ai, using either **AI Store** or **AI Knowledge**, depending on the user's permissions and organizational context.

It offers a secure, AI-powered conversational experience that can be **public** to the instance or **scoped** to a specific entity, based on access rules and SSI (Security & Information Systems) configurations.

---

## Creation Options

You can create a SecureChat agent using one of the following methods:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Manual Creation via AI Store or AI Knowledge">
Users with sufficient permissions can create SecureChat agents manually through the platform UI:
- Navigate to **AI Store** (for general-purpose assistants)
- Or go to **AI Knowledge > Agents** (for knowledge-centric assistants)
- Set visibility (`public`, `group-limited` on Users tab, etc.)
- Define agent prompt, tools, documents, and runtime settings
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Automated via AI Builder">
Use automation to define and deploy agents across environments:

Example workflow:

```yaml
slug: create-agent-securechat
name: Create agent SecureChat
do:
  - set:
      name: agents
      value:
        - name: SecureChat
          category: Productivity
          public: true
          description: Your AI-powered professional assistant for daily work tasks.
          ai:
            max_tokens: 1500
            prompt: |
              You are a virtual assistant designed to support employees in their daily professional tasks...
  - repeat:
      on: '{{agents}}'
      do:
        - Knowledge Client.Projects - Update or Create project:
            data: '{{item}}'
```
This ensures traceability and multi-environment management.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Agent Capabilities

A SecureChat agent typically supports:

- **Summarization** of documents and meeting notes
- **Comparison** between files or texts
- **Rephrasing** and rewriting content
- **Drafting** emails, notes, or reports
- **Web search** (if enabled) with source citations
- **Secure document handling** with contextual processing

Each response type is designed with formatting standards and structured output (e.g., tables, bullets, or paragraph summaries).

## Configuration Options

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Visibility & Access Control">
- Set `public: true` to make the agent visible to all users.
- Or `public: false`  and then assign access by **group**, **entity**, or **workspace role** using an automation on AI Builder
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="LLM & Prompting">
- Connect to multiple LLMs (OpenAI, Mistral, Claude, Ollama…)
- Define a prompt depending on use case  to define tone, role, behavior
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

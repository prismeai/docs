AI Store is the main entry point for users to access, explore, and interact with AI agents. It serves as a workspace-centric product where users can chat, select models, collaborate with AI using Prisme.ai Canvas, and manage their AI experience.

This page explains how to configure AI Store in a self-hosted setup, including onboarding, theming, privacy controls, and customization of behavior per user profile.

## Global Configuration Schema

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Onboarding">
The onboarding experience can be customized in HTML with localized messages, and configured to show:
- **Once per session** (default for most)
- **Always** (e.g., for new user education)

```yaml
onBoardingPolicy: always
onBoarding:
  en: "<h2>Welcome to AI Store</h2>..."
  fr: "<h2>Bienvenue sur AI Store</h2>..."
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Themes (Light & Dark)">
AI Store supports full UI theming. You can override colors using CSS variables under `themes.light.variables` and `themes.dark.variables`.

Example:
```yaml
themes:
  light:
    variables:
      primary: '#015dff'
      layout-surface: '#ffffff'
  dark:
    variables:
      main-text: '#f8faff'
      layout-surface: '#212121'
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="User Roles & Access">
AI Store visibility is governed by the workspace’s **RBAC rules**. SecureChat agents within AI Store can be:
- **Public** to the entire instance
- **Scoped** to specific groups or SSI-based entities
- **Manually assigned** per role or via automation

Beta testers can be whitelisted via email for early access:
```yaml
betaTesters: 'alice@company.com,bob@company.com'
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Policies & Legal Links">
You can define custom links to T&C and privacy policies:

```yaml
links:
  cgu: https://www.prisme.ai/en/mentions-legales
  policy: https://www.prisme.ai/en/politique-de-confidentialite
```
These are displayed at the bottom of the AI Store interface.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Guidance Messages">
Input guidance can be localized and shown above the message input:

```yaml
inputGuidanceMessage:
  en: "This agent can make mistakes. Check important info."
  fr: "Cet agent peut faire des erreurs. Vérifiez les informations importantes."
```
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

---

## Canvas Custom Actions

AI Store integrates tightly with **Canvas**, allowing agents to process rich structured content. You can configure default AI behaviors for canvas interactions:

```yaml
canvas:
  actionsPrompt:
    translate:
      default: Translate the canvas document to [value].
    improve:
      default: Polish the canvas content. Improve clarity, style, and format.
    debug:
      default: Help debug the canvas code.
```

These prompts are displayed as button suggestions and passed to the LLM agent to guide interaction.

---

## Upload & Retention Settings

Files uploaded via AI Store (for context or RAG) are retained for a configurable duration:

```yaml
uploadDuration: 86400 # in seconds (24h default)
```

This value can be adapted per workspace or globally depending on your document handling policies.

---

## Agent Creation

AI Store  can contain multiple agents, each with:

- Unique names, descriptions, prompts, and categories
- Access rules and visibility constraints
- Tools and document collection bindings
- Monitoring and usage tracking

Agents can be created:
- **Manually** via AI Store for basic configuration and AI Knowledge for advanced settings.
- **Automatically** via AI Builder workflows
- **Imported** from other environments (e.g. DEV → PROD) using CI/CD and Prisme.ai APIs

---

## Monitoring & Analytics

All agent usage within AI Store is traceable via:

- **Workspace activity logs on AI Builder**
- **Analytics on AI Knowledge**
- **Centralized OpenSearch/ElasticSearch**
- **Feedback collection** (thumbs up/down and comments)
- **Metrics via Prometheus** (e.g., avg. response time)

---

## Example Integration in `index.yaml` of AI Store workspace on AI Builder

```yaml
aiStore:
  enabled: true
  onboarding:
    policy: always
    html: "<h2>Welcome to AI Store</h2>..."
  inputGuidanceMessage:
    fr: "Cet agent peut faire des erreurs. Vérifiez les informations importantes."
    en: "This agent can make mistakes. Check important info."
  links:
    cgu: https://www.prisme.ai/en/mentions-legales
    policy: https://www.prisme.ai/en/politique-de-confidentialite
  betaTesters: "alice@company.com,bob@company.com"
  uploadDuration: 86400
```

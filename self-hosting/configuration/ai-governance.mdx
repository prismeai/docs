title: 'Configuring AI Governance'
description: 'Control AI usage, security, and access across your Prisme.ai platform.'
---


AI Governance is the control tower of your Prisme.ai environment. It allows **administrators and IT leaders** to monitor, secure, and govern the use of AI across all products and teams.

You can manage:
- Authentication and SSO providers
- RBAC (role-based access control)
- Workspace provisioning and quotas
- Interface customization
- User feedback and platform policies

---

## Initialization

To enable AI Governance, you must generate a **super admin token**:

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Get your JWT token">
Log in to Prisme.ai with a **super admin** account and retrieve your JWT from the `access-token` cookie.
</Step>

<Step title="Step 2: Generate the long-term token">
Use the following command from inside the Prisme.ai internal network (or from a pod):

```bash
curl 'https://<API_URL>/v2/user/accessTokens' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT>" \
  --data-raw '{"name":"ai-governance","expiresAt":"2027-01-24T11:53:12.116Z"}'
```
</Step>

<Step title="Step 3: Inject the access token">
In the **AI Governance** secrets, paste the token under the `adminAccessToken` field.
</Step>

<Step title="Step 4: Configure API access">
Get your workspace ID from the browser and add:

```env
WORKSPACE_OPS_MANAGER=https://<API_URL>/v2/workspaces/<WORKSPACE_ID>/webhooks/
```

This can be injected via Helm values under `prismeai-console.workspace_ops_manager`.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Interface Personalization

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Customize Branding & Texts">
- Go to **Interface Customization**
- Update the **logo**, **colors**, and **translations** for all pages
- Personalize sign-in / sign-up / forgot password texts
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Configure SSO Providers">
To customize login options, define the following environment variable in prismeai-console and prismeai-pages :

```json
ENABLED_AUTH_PROVIDERS='[{ "name": "local" }, { "name": "custom", "label": { "fr":"Connexion avec custom", "en":"Connect with custom" }, "icon":"http://logo.png"}]'
```
You can mix local and SSO authentication options.

You can also disable local signup with the following environment variable :  

```json
DISABLE_LOCAL_SIGNUP='true'
```
Also add this variable to prismeai-api-gateway to disable the corresponding API.  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Add Legal & Help Pages">
Under `Interface Customization > Links`, configure:
- Privacy Policy
- Help
- Feedback
- Change Log

You can use custom pages built in AI Builder with **RichText** or **Form** blocks.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## SSO Access
If you have your own SSO configured, you need to explicitly allow SSO authenticated users to access the **Teams** administration pages :

1. Open **Teams Service** workspace
2. Open **Settings** \> **Advanced**
3. **Manage roles**
4. Add your SSO provider technical name after `prismeai: {}` at the very beginning :

```yaml
authorizations:
  roles:
    editor: {}
    user:
      auth:
        prismeai: {}
        yourOwnSso: {}
```

Access to other pages from AI Governance itself will automatically be authorized based on users custom role in AI Governance workspace.  

---

## Roles and Permissions

AI Governance uses **RBAC** to manage platform access:

- Assign the `PlatformAdmin` role to users for full control
- Use `PlatformManager` to delegate governance tasks
- Refine access to each product under the **Roles** tab

Default roles include `Admin`, `Builder`, `KnowledgeAdmin`, `User`, etc.

To give a user access to AI Governance:
1. Go to **Users & Permissions**
2. Assign the **PlatformManager** role in the *Manager* column

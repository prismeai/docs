description: 'Learn how to manage user access and permissions across different layers of the Prisme.ai platform'
---


Prisme.ai implements a comprehensive, multi-layered authorization system that ensures secure access control across the platform. This guide explains how permissions work at each level and provides instructions for effective permission management.


## Understanding the Authorization Model

Prisme.ai's authorization system operates at four distinct layers:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Super Admins" icon="user-crown">
    Technical or management users with platform-wide access configured at the infrastructure level
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workspace Roles" icon="folder-tree">
    Developer and manager permissions assigned on a workspace-by-workspace basis
  </Card>
  <Card title="SSO Access" icon="id-badge">
    End-user access controls configured for each workspace with SSO integration
  </Card>
  <Card title="Product Roles" icon="user-gear">
    Fine-grained permissions assigned to user groups within individual products
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Key Concepts and Terminology

Before diving into permission details, it's important to understand the distinction between two fundamental concepts:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Workspaces">
    
    **Workspaces are dedicated environments where you can build, manage, and run agents, as well as implement all custom or project-specific logic.**
    
    - Accessible via the **AI Builder** section in the left-hand menu  
    - Similar to software management projects or team workspaces in traditional environments  
    - Designed for tech teams to create, configure, and maintain AI-powered applications  
    - Contain automations, blocks, pages, and other reusable development resources  
    - Centralize all activity: end-user interactions, audit logs, and execution traces
    
    Workspaces are the foundation of Prisme.ai's AI Builder. They empower teams to design, test, and deploy custom AI solutions tailored to their unique business needs.

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Products">
    
    **Products are user-facing applications built on workspaces.**
    
    - Listed below **AI Builder** in the left menu
    - Web pages, applications, or APIs designed for end users
    - End users interact with products but typically don't have access to underlying workspaces
    - Represent the "production" deployments of applications
    
    Products are what your end users will interact with, while the workspaces are where you build and configure these products.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Understanding this distinction is crucial because permissions are applied differently at the workspace level versus the product level.

## Super Admins

Super Admins have the highest level of access across the entire Prisme.ai platform.

<Accordion title="Capabilities and Scope">
  Super Admins can:
  
  - Access, share, and update **every existing workspace**
  - View all events, configurations, and automations
  - Manage all aspects of the platform
  - Install, update, and configure Prisme.ai products
  
  This is the most powerful role and essentially makes the user an owner of every workspace.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Configuration">
  Super Admin access is configured at the infrastructure level:
  
  **Option 1: Environment Variable**
  
  Set the `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS` environment variable in the **api-gateway** microservice:
  
  ```bash
  SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS=admin1@example.com,admin2@example.com
  ```
  
  **Option 2: Helm Configuration**
  
  Configure via the `api-gateway.config.admins` helm value in the `prismeai-core` chart:
  
  ```yaml
  api-gateway:
    config:
      admins:
        - admin1@example.com
        - admin2@example.com
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Best Practices">
  While Super Admins have extensive privileges, we recommend:
  
  - Limiting the number of Super Admin accounts to minimize security risks
  - Using Super Admin accounts primarily for installation, updates, and platform configuration
  - For day-to-day operations, Super Admins should share important workspaces (AI Knowledge, AI Store...) with secondary accounts that have more limited permissions
  - Regularly review and audit the list of Super Admin accounts
  
  **Important Note:** Although Super Admins manage all workspaces, they might not automatically have admin access to all products since products can have their own permission layer. However, Super Admins can always grant themselves the necessary product permissions from the workspace level.
</Accordion>

## Workspace Roles

Workspace roles control who can access and modify specific workspaces in Prisme.ai.

<Accordion title="Available Roles">
  Workspaces support various roles with different permission levels:
  
  - **Owner**: Full control over the workspace, including sharing with others
  - **Editor**: Can modify workspace content but has limited administrative capabilities
  - **Custom Roles**: Additional roles can be defined with specialized permissions
  
  Each role determines what actions a user can perform within the workspace.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What Workspace Roles Control">
  Users with workspace access can:
  
  - Update workspace configuration and secrets
  - Search through activity events for debugging or auditing
  - Modify automations and pages to develop new features
  - Access the workspace's development environment
  - Deploy changes to associated products
  
  These permissions are critical for developers and administrators who need to build and maintain applications.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Managing Workspace Roles">
  To share a workspace with other users:
  
  1. Navigate to the workspace in the AI Builder section
  2. Click on the "Share" button in the workspace header
  3. Enter the email address of the user
  4. Select the appropriate role from the dropdown
  5. Click "Add" to grant access
  
  You can also modify or revoke existing permissions from this same interface.
</Accordion>

## SSO Access

SSO (Single Sign-On) access controls which end users can access product pages when authenticating through your identity provider.

<Accordion title="How SSO Access Works">
  Prisme.ai products like AI Knowledge and AI Store use custom security rules to automatically grant access to authenticated SSO users.
  
  These rules:
  - Are configured at the workspace level
  - Typically grant access only to the user-facing pages
  - Can be customized to provide different levels of access based on user attributes
  - Allow end users to access products without requiring individual account setup
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Configuring SSO Access">
  To configure SSO access for a product:
  
  1. Access the product's workspace through AI Builder
  2. Navigate to the workspace settings
  3. Look for the Security or SSO section
  4. Configure the authentication providers 
  5. Define rules for automatic role assignment based on user attributes
  
  For example, you might create rules that assign specific roles based on group membership in your identity provider :  
  ```yaml
  authorizations:
    roles:
      user:
        auth:
          yourOwnSso: {}
    rules:
      - role: user
        action:
          - read
        subject: pages
        conditions:
          labels: users
  ```
  With this security rules, every user authenticated with `yourOwnSso` will automatically have `user` role, defining the `{{user.role}} == "user"` variable and giving access to every pages with a `users` label.  
  See [RBAC for more advanced rules](/products/ai-builder/rbac)  
</Accordion>

<Note>
  While SSO rules typically only grant access to user-facing pages, they can be configured to provide full workspace access, similar to [owner roles](#workspace-roles), if needed.
</Note>

## Product Roles

Product roles provide fine-grained control over what users can do within specific Prisme.ai products.

<Accordion title="Understanding Product Roles">
  Unlike workspace roles, which control access to development environments, product roles determine:
  
  - What features users can access within a product
  - What actions they can perform
  - What data they can view or modify
  
  These roles are managed through AI Governance and apply to the end-user experience of the products.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example Product Roles">
  Different products come with predefined roles. For example, in AI Knowledge:
  
  - **Product Admin**: Can access analytics, all existing projects, and create new ones
  - **Knowledge User**: Can only access shared projects and cannot create new ones
  
  Product role capabilities are specific to each product and provide targeted permission controls.
  
  **Important Note**: Even users with the **Product Admin** role cannot change the product's configuration (e.g., LLM providers, models, rate limits) unless they also have access to the corresponding workspace.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Managing Product Roles through AI Governance">
  AI Governance allows admins to:
  
  - Enable or disable users
  - Update basic user information
  - Manage user groups
  - Assign product roles to users or groups
  
  To access these features:
  
  1. Navigate to AI Governance in the left menu
  2. Select "Users & Permissions"
  3. Find the user or create a new user
  4. Assign the appropriate product roles
  
  To grant management access to AI Governance itself, a **Manager** role must be assigned from the same "Users & Permissions" page.
</Accordion>

## Permission Management Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Least Privilege Principle" icon="shield-check">
    **Assign only the minimum permissions needed**
    
    - Grant users only the access they need to perform their jobs
    - Regularly review and revoke unnecessary permissions
    - Use time-limited access when possible for temporary needs
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Role-Based Access Control" icon="users-gear">
    **Organize permissions by role, not individual users**
    
    - Create roles that align with job functions
    - Assign users to appropriate roles
    - Modify role definitions rather than creating one-off permissions
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Regular Audits" icon="clipboard-check">
    **Review permissions periodically**
    
    - Schedule regular permission reviews
    - Check for outdated access after role changes
    - Audit Super Admin accounts especially carefully
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Document Access Policies" icon="file-lines">
    **Create clear permission guidelines**
    
    - Document which roles have access to what resources
    - Establish approval processes for elevated access
    - Provide clear procedures for requesting access changes
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Understanding Permission Interactions

When a user attempts to perform an action in Prisme.ai, their permissions are evaluated across multiple layers:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authentication Validation">
    First, the system verifies the user is properly authenticated, either through:
    - Local username/password
    - SSO provider credentials
    - API key or token validation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Super Admin Check">
    If the user is a Super Admin, they generally have full access to all workspaces but might still need specific product roles.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Workspace Permission Evaluation">
    For workspace access:
    - The system checks if the user has been explicitly granted a role
    - It evaluates any SSO-based role assignments
    - It determines the specific capabilities based on the assigned role
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Product Permission Evaluation">
    For product features:
    - The system verifies product-specific roles assigned in AI Governance
    - It checks any group memberships that might grant additional permissions
    - It enforces feature and data access based on these roles
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Remember that workspace access and product access are separate layers. A user might have admin rights to a product without having access to its underlying workspace, or vice versa.
</Warning>

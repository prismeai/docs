---


Prisme.ai's architecture includes specialized microservices that support specific applications like Custom Code, Crawler, Search Engine ... This guide explains how to deploy these additional microservices in your self-hosted environment.


<Note>
  **License Requirement**

  The microservices discussed in this guide are available based on your subscription license. Ensure your license includes access to these components before proceeding with deployment.
</Note>

## Access Requirements

<Warning>
  You will need valid GitLab credentials to access the Docker images for these microservices. If you don't have them yet, please contact [support@prisme.ai](mailto:support@prisme.ai) to obtain a GitLab username and token.
</Warning>

These credentials are typically provided as a GitLab Deploy Token with appropriate permissions to pull the required images.

## Deployment Strategy

We will deploy the apps microservices in the same Kubernetes cluster as the core microservices. However, for better resource isolation and management, we recommend using a separate namespace for these additional services.


## Prerequisites

Each microservice has specific requirements that must be fulfilled before deployment. Review the prerequisites for each service you plan to deploy:

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Deployment Process

Follow these steps to deploy the apps microservices in your Kubernetes cluster:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Retrieve the Helm Charts">
    You have two options for accessing the required Helm charts:

    **Option 1: Download the charts directly**

    ```
    helm repo add prismeai https://helm.prisme.ai/charts
    helm pull prismeai/prismeai-apps
    ls
    ```

    Extract the archive to access the chart files.

    **Option 2: Add as a Helm repository**

    ```bash
    helm repo add prismeai https://helm.prisme.ai/charts
    helm repo update
    ```

    Then generate a values file template:

    ```bash
    helm show values prismeai/prismeai-apps > ./values.yml
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Values File">
    Edit the `values.yaml` file to include connection details and credentials for external services:

    Key configuration areas include:

    - **Container registry credentials**: Your GitLab access details
    - **Service-specific settings**: Configuration for each microservice
    - **Database configurations**: Connection details for required databases
    - **Resource allocations**: CPU, memory, and storage requirements
    - **Network settings**: Service endpoints and ports

    Refer to each service's documentation for specific configuration requirements.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Namespace">
    Create a dedicated namespace for the apps microservices:

    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace apps
    ```

    This separation provides better resource isolation and management compared to deploying everything in the default namespace.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy using Helm">
    Choose the appropriate deployment command based on how you retrieved the charts:

    **If you downloaded the charts (Option 1):**

    ```bash
    # From the root of the extracted directory
    helm install apps . --namespace apps -f values.yaml
    ```

    **If you added the repo (Option 2):**

    ```bash
    helm install apps prismeai/prismeai-apps --namespace apps -f values.yaml
    ```

    The deployment will create all necessary Kubernetes resources in the `apps` namespace.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Deployment">
    Check that all pods are running correctly:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n apps
    ```

    Ensure all services show `Running` status and are ready (e.g., `1/1` for readiness).

    You can get more detailed information about any pod with:

    ```bash
    kubectl describe pod [pod-name] -n apps
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing the Microservices

After deployment, test each microservice to ensure it's functioning correctly:

<Accordion title="prismeai-crawler and prismeai-searchengine">
  Follow the testing procedures in the [prismeai-crawler documentation](../configuration/prismeai-crawler/index.md#microservice-testing).

  Typical tests include:

  - Creating a crawl job for a test website
  - Verifying content is properly indexed
  - Testing search functionality with simple queries
  - Checking crawler logs for any errors
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="prismeai-functions">
  Refer to the [prismeai-functions testing guide](../configuration/prismeai-functions/index.md#microservice-testing).

  Key validation steps:

  - Executing a simple function through the API
  - Verifying resource limits are properly enforced
  - Testing error handling for invalid code
  - Checking integration with other Prisme.ai components
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="prismeai-llm">
  Use the [prismeai-llm testing procedures](../configuration/prismeai-llm/index.md#microservice-testing) to verify functionality.

  Important tests include:

  - Testing model inference with a simple prompt
  - Verifying token counting functionality
  - Checking integration with supported models
  - Validating logging and monitoring features
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<Accordion title="Image Pull Errors">
  **Symptom**: Pods show `ImagePullBackOff` status

  **Possible causes**:
  - Invalid GitLab credentials
  - Incorrect image repository URL
  - Network connectivity issues

  **Resolution steps**:
  1. Verify your GitLab credentials are correct
  2. Check the image repository URL in your values file
  3. Create a Kubernetes secret with your credentials:
     ```bash
     kubectl create secret docker-registry gitlab-registry \
       --docker-server=registry.gitlab.com \
       --docker-username=YOUR_USERNAME \
       --docker-password=YOUR_TOKEN \
       --namespace apps
     ```
  4. Update your deployment to use this secret
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Configuration Errors">
  **Symptom**: Pods start but quickly crash or enter CrashLoopBackOff

  **Possible causes**:
  - Missing or incorrect environment variables
  - Invalid database connection details
  - Insufficient permissions or resources

  **Resolution steps**:
  1. Check pod logs for specific error messages:
     ```bash
     kubectl logs [pod-name] -n apps
     ```
  2. Verify database connectivity from within the cluster
  3. Ensure all required environment variables are set
  4. Check resource allocations match the service requirements
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Service Connectivity Issues">
  **Symptom**: Services start but can't communicate with each other

  **Possible causes**:
  - Incorrect service names or ports
  - Network policies blocking traffic
  - DNS resolution problems

  **Resolution steps**:
  1. Verify service endpoints using:
     ```bash
     kubectl get services -n apps
     ```
  2. Test connectivity using a debug pod:
     ```bash
     kubectl run debug-pod --rm -it --image=nginx:alpine -- sh
     # Inside the pod
     wget -O- http://service-name.apps.svc.cluster.local:port/health
     ```
  3. Check network policies that might be restricting traffic
  4. Ensure CoreDNS is functioning properly
</Accordion>

## Upgrading Microservices

When new versions of the apps microservices become available:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update Helm Repository">
    If using the Helm repository approach:

    ```bash
    helm repo update
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check for Changes">
    Review the changes in the new version:

    ```bash
    helm show values prismeai/prismeai-apps > ./new-values.yml
    diff values.yaml new-values.yml
    ```

    Update your values file as needed to accommodate any new configuration options.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Perform the Upgrade">
    Upgrade the deployment with:

    ```bash
    helm upgrade apps prismeai/prismeai-apps --namespace apps -f values.yaml
    ```

    Or if using the downloaded chart:

    ```bash
    helm upgrade apps . --namespace apps -f values.yaml
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Upgrade">
    Check that all pods are running the new version:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n apps
    ```

    And verify functionality using the testing procedures mentioned above.
  </Step>
</Steps>

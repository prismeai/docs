  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuring OIDC Authentication

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register an Application">
    Create an OAuth 2.0 client in your OIDC provider.

    
    **Key configuration:**
    1. Register a **Web** OAuth2 client/app
    2. Configure the authorized redirect URI:
       ```
       https://API_URL/v2/login/callback
       ```
    3. Request the following scopes (minimum):
       ```
       openid email
       ```
    4. Add `profile` scope if you need first name and last name
    
    **Note the following credentials:**
    - Client ID
    - Client Secret
    - Auth URL (authorization_endpoint)
    - Token URL (token_endpoint)
    - Certificate URL (jwks_uri)
    
    <Note>
      The JWKS URI might not be shown with client details as it is generally global to the IdP or tenant. This URL can return either a standard JWKS or an object mapping `kid`s to PEM certificate strings.
      
      Currently, only the **RS256** algorithm is supported.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Configuration File">
    Create an `authProviders.config.yml` file with your OIDC provider details.
    
    ```yaml
    providers:
      <ProviderName>:
        type: oidc
        config:
          client_id: "your client id"
          client_secret: "your client secret"
          authorization_endpoint: "idp authorization_endpoint"
          token_endpoint: "idp token_endpoint"
          jwks_uri: "idp public certificates endpoint"
          scopes: "openid email profile"
        attributesMapping:
          firstName: 'given_name'
          lastName: 'family_name'
          email: 'email'
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      Choose your `<ProviderName>` carefully, as this name will be used in front-end services and injected into user authData, making it potentially difficult to change later.
    </Warning>
    
    - The `scopes` field is optional and defaults to `openid email`
    - The minimum required scopes are `openid` and `email`
    - Add `profile` scope to retrieve additional user attributes like name
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring SAML Authentication

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register Service Provider">
    Register Prisme.ai as a Service Provider (SP) in your Identity Provider.
  
    
    **Key configuration:**
    1. Configure the **ACS Endpoint**:
       ```
       https://API_URL/v2/login/callback
       ```
    2. Set the **SP EntityID** : must match the `audience` configured below
    3. Set **Name ID format** to `unspecified` (all formats are supported)
    
    **Export the IdP metadata XML file** containing the signing certificate and entity information.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Configuration File">
    Create an `authProviders.config.yml` file with your SAML provider details.
    
    ```yaml
    providers:
      <ProviderName>:
        type: saml
        config:
          idp_metadata_filepath: "/path/towards/idp-saml-metadata.xml"
          audience: "Service Provider entity id"  
          issuer: "Issuer entity id, can be set to audience value"  
        attributesMapping:
          firstName: 'http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname'
          lastName: 'http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/surname'
          email: 'http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress'
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      Choose your `<ProviderName>` carefully, as this name will be used in front-end services and injected into user authData, making it potentially difficult to change later.
    </Warning>
    
    If no XML file is available, you can configure individual parameters:
    
    ```yaml
    providers:
      <ProviderName>:
        type: saml
        config:
          entryPoint: "https://idp.example.org/SAML2/SSO/Redirect"
          idpCert: "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIID...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
          audience: "Service Provider entity id"
          issuer: "Service Provider entity id"
    ```
    
    See [node-saml documentation](https://github.com/node-saml/node-saml) for complete configuration options.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Mount Configuration File  

Whether you configured an OIDC or SAML provider, you can now mount the configuration file inside the `prismeai-api-gateway` container at `/www/services/api-gateway/authProviders.config.yml`.  
You can customize the file location with the `AUTH_PROVIDERS_CONFIG` environment variable.  

For **Kubernetes**, store the configuration file in a configmap :  
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: prismeai-api-gateway-authproviders
  namespace: core
data:
  authProviders.config.yml: |-
    providers:
      providerName:
        ...
```
    
Add the following `volume` and `volumeMount` to `prismeai-api-gateway` deployment :  
```yaml
volumes:
  - name: gateway-authproviders
    configMap:
      name: prismeai-api-gateway-authproviders

volumeMounts:
  - name: gateway-authproviders
    mountPath: /www/services/api-gateway/authProviders.config.yml
    subPath: authProviders.config.yml
```

## Configuring Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register an Application">
    Register a new application in your Microsoft Entra ID tenant.
    
    1. Navigate to **Azure Portal** > **App registrations**
    2. Click **New registration**
    3. Name the application (e.g., "Prisme.ai")
    4. Select the appropriate **Supported account types**:
       - Accounts in this organizational directory only
       - Accounts in any organizational directory
       - Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts
       - Personal Microsoft accounts only
    5. Set the **Redirect URI** platform to **Web** with the value:
       ```
       https://API_URL/v2/login/azure/callback
       ```
    6. Click **Register**
    
    **Note the Application (client) ID** displayed on the overview page.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate a Client Secret">
    Create a secret for authentication.
    
    
    1. Navigate to **Certificates & secrets** in the left menu
    2. Click **New client secret**
    3. Add a description and select an expiry period
    4. Click **Add**
    
    **Immediately copy and store the client secret value**, as it won't be visible again.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Environment Variables">
    Set the required environment variables in the `prismeai-api-gateway` service.
    
    ```bash
    # Microsoft Entra ID Configuration
    AZURE_AD_CLOUD_INSTANCE_ID=https://login.microsoftonline.com/
    AZURE_AD_TENANT=YourCompany.onmicrosoft.com
    AZURE_AD_APP_ID=your-application-id
    AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
    ```
    
    For the `AZURE_AD_TENANT` value:
    - Use your tenant domain (e.g., `YourCompany.onmicrosoft.com`) for single-tenant apps
    - Use `organizations` for multi-tenant organizational accounts
    - Use `common` for both organizational and personal accounts
    - Use `consumers` for Microsoft accounts only
    
    <Note>
      The `AZURE_AD_TENANT` value should match the **Supported account types** option you selected when registering the app.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Enable the Provider in UI
Configure the sign-in buttons by setting environment variables.

For both `prismeai-console` and `prismeai-pages` microservices, add this environment variable :  

```
ENABLED_AUTH_PROVIDERS='[{"name": "local"}, {"name": "<ProviderName>", "label": "Sign in with Provider", "icon": "https://path/to/provider-icon.png"}]'
```

- `name` must match the `<ProviderName>` in your config file
- `label` is the text displayed on the sign-in button
- `icon` is the URL to the provider's logo image
- Include `{"name": "local"}` to keep the username/password login option

For **Azure AD**, add a `"extends":"azure"` option  :  
```
ENABLED_AUTH_PROVIDERS='[{"name":"local"},{"name":"custom","extends":"azure","label":{"fr":"Connexion avec Microsoft","en":"Sign in with Microsoft"},"icon":"https://path/to/microsoft-logo.png"}]'
```

## Disable local signup

Disable local signup with the following environment variable in prismeai-console, prismeai-pages and prismeai-api-gateway :  
```
DISABLE_LOCAL_SIGNUP='true'
```

## Configure products SSO access

Update workspaces to automatically grant access to certain products to [SSO-authenticated users](/self-hosting/entreprise/permissions#sso-access) :  

- [**AI Knowledge**](self-hosting/configuration/ai-knowledge#sso-access)
- [**AI Insights**](self-hosting/configuration/ai-insights#sso-access)

<Note>
  Whenever you change your `PAGES_HOST` environment variable, make sure to trigger a workspace update (e.g., by changing its description) to register the new redirect URI with your identity provider.
</Note>

## Custom Attribute Mapping

All authentication methods support mapping identity provider attributes to Prisme.ai user properties:

<Accordion title="Attribute Mapping Configuration">
  The `attributesMapping` section in your provider configuration maps provider-specific attributes to standard Prisme.ai fields.
  
  ```yaml
  providers:
    <ProviderName>:
      type: oidc  # or saml
      # ... other config ...
      attributesMapping:
        firstName: 'provider_first_name_field'
        lastName: 'provider_last_name_field'
        email: 'provider_email_field'
  ```
  
  Only `firstName`, `lastName`, and `email` are supported as native fields.
  
  **Common OIDC Mappings:**
  ```yaml
  attributesMapping:
    firstName: 'given_name'
    lastName: 'family_name'
    email: 'email'
  ```
  
  **Common SAML Mappings:**
  ```yaml
  attributesMapping:
    firstName: 'http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname'
    lastName: 'http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/surname'
    email: 'http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress'
  ```
  
  You can inspect available attributes by examining `gateway.login.succeeded` events or by reading the `{{user}}` variable from a test automation.
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Common Issues and Solutions">
  **1. Redirect URI Mismatch**
  
  **Symptom:** Error message about redirect URI not matching during authentication
  
  **Solution:** 
  - Ensure the redirect URI in your IdP exactly matches `https://API_URL/v2/login/callback` for OIDC/SAML or `https://API_URL/v2/login/azure/callback` for Microsoft
  - Check for trailing slashes or HTTP vs HTTPS mismatches
  
  **2. JWKS Retrieval Failed**
  
  **Symptom:** Authentication fails with JWKS errors
  
  **Solution:**
  - Verify the `jwks_uri` endpoint is accessible from the Prisme.ai server
  - Check for correct formatting of the JWKS endpoint URL
  - Ensure the signing algorithm is RS256
  
  **3. SAML Response Validation Failed**
  
  **Symptom:** SAML authentication fails after IdP redirect
  
  **Solution:**
  - Confirm the IdP certificate in the configuration is correct and not expired
  - Verify the IdP is sending responses via HTTP-POST binding
  - Check that the `issuer` value matches the EntityID expected by the IdP
  - Try adding `skipRequestCompression: true` and `wantAuthnResponseSigned: false` SAML options  
  
  **4. Missing User Attributes**
  
  **Symptom:** User logs in successfully but name fields are empty
  
  **Solution:**
  - Check that the `attributesMapping` configuration matches the actual attribute names provided by your IdP
  - For OIDC, ensure the `profile` scope is requested if you need name attributes
  - Examine the authentication events to see what claims are actually being received
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Diagnostic Tools">
  **Event Logs**
  
  Authentication issues can be diagnosed by examining events in the Activity view:
  
  - Look for `gateway.login.started` events to see authentication attempts
  - Check `gateway.login.succeeded` events to examine the received user claims
  - Investigate `gateway.login.failed` events for error details
  
  **Configuration Testing**
  
  You can validate your SSO configuration by:
  
  1. Creating a test user in your IdP
  2. Attempting authentication with detailed logs enabled
  3. Examining the request/response data in the Activity logs
  
  **Common Error Codes**
  
  - `invalid_request`: Malformed authentication request
  - `unauthorized_client`: The client is not authorized for the requested authentication flow
  - `access_denied`: The resource owner denied the request
  - `invalid_token`: JWT validation failed
  - `invalid_grant`: The provided authorization grant is invalid
</Accordion>

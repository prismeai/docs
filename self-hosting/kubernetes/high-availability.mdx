title: 'High Availability on Kubernetes'
description: 'Designing and deploying Prisme.ai for high availability and fault tolerance on Kubernetes clusters.'
---

Ensuring high availability (HA) is crucial for maintaining uptime, minimizing service disruption, and supporting critical workloads in production. This guide explains how to design, deploy, and operate Prisme.ai with HA in mind on Kubernetes.

---

## Why High Availability Matters

A high-availability deployment ensures:

- **No single point of failure**
- **Redundant services** distributed across zones or regions
- **Automated failover and recovery**
- **Increased uptime** for business-critical use cases

---

## Key HA Components

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Kubernetes Cluster Architecture">
- **Use multi-zone clusters**: Spread nodes across at least 2 availability zones.
- **Control Plane Resilience**: Managed Kubernetes services like EKS, GKE, AKS provide HA for control planes by default.
- **Auto-scaling enabled**: Ensure node groups scale with demand to avoid overloads.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Microservice Redundancy">
- **Replicas**: Deploy multiple replicas of core services:
  - API Gateway: 2+
  - Runtime: 3+
  - Console/Studio: 2+
  - Pages: 2+
- Use Kubernetes Deployments with readiness and liveness probes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Load Balancing & Ingress">
- **Ingress controllers**: Use cloud-native ingress controllers (e.g., ALB, NGINX, Istio) with health checks and retries.
- **DNS**: Configure DNS to route traffic across healthy zones (e.g., Route 53 with latency-based routing).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Stateless vs Stateful Services">
- Stateless services (API, Console, Pages, Runtime) should be scaled freely.
- Stateful services (MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch) must use clustered, HA configurations with persistent storage.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Storage Availability">
- Use **replicated storage backends** like:
  - AWS EBS Multi-AZ (via EFS or FSx)
  - Azure Files with zone-redundant storage
  - GCP Filestore with regional redundancy
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Example: Minimal HA Setup

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: api-gateway
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: api-gateway
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: api-gateway
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: api-gateway
        image: prismeai/api-gateway:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3001
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 3001
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 10
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /ready
            port: 3001
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 10
```

## Resilient Databases

<CardGroup cols={2}>

<Card title="MongoDB Replica Set" icon="database">
- Deploy MongoDB as a 3-node replica set.
- Use StatefulSets and persistent volumes.
- Prefer managed services with automatic failover.
</Card>

<Card title="Elasticsearch Cluster" icon="magnifying-glass">
- Use 3 data nodes and 3 master nodes.
- Enable snapshot-based backups.
- Ensure cluster quorum during restarts or scaling.
</Card>

<Card title="Redis HA" icon="memory">
- Use Redis Sentinel or Redis Cluster.
- Use persistent storage and multi-zone replication.
- Prefer managed Redis services like AWS ElastiCache or Azure Cache for Redis.
</Card>

<Card title="Storage Redundancy" icon="file">
- Ensure shared volumes (for uploads or workspace files) are RWX and support replication.
- Use cloud-native backup and snapshot solutions.
</Card>

</CardGroup>

## Monitoring and Self-Healing

- Use **Prometheus and Grafana** for live dashboards and alerting.
- Implement **Kubernetes PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs)** to prevent all pods from being evicted at once.
- Add **Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA)** for runtime services.

Example PodDisruptionBudget:
```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: runtime-ha-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: runtime
```

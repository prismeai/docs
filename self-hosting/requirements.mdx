---

To successfully deploy and manage Prisme.ai within your infrastructure, you need to ensure that your environment meets specific prerequisites related to resources, services, and configurations.

## Infrastructure Recommendations

Prisme.ai recommends the following baseline infrastructure to ensure smooth operation:

- **Nodes**: At least 3 Kubernetes nodes with 4 vCPU and 16GB RAM each【40:1†source】.
- **Disk Space**: Minimum 50GB recommended for persistent storage.
- **High Availability**: Use managed services or clusters with redundancy capabilities.
- **Load Balancer**: Ingress controller or cloud load balancer required for service routing.

## Database Requirements

Ensure the following database setups for optimal performance and reliability:

- **MongoDB**:
  - Version: 6.x or newer
  - Configuration: 3-node replica set, each with at least 2GB RAM, 2 vCPU, and 1,000 IOPS【32:2†source】.
- **Redis**:
  - Version: 5.x or newer
  - Configuration: Separate instances recommended for cache and broker, each with at least 3GB RAM and 2 vCPU【32:2†source】.
- **Elasticsearch/OpenSearch**:
  - Version: 8.x or newer
  - Configuration: 3-node cluster, each node with 16GB RAM and 4 vCPU【32:3†source】.

### AI Products requirements

AI Products installation also require a **vector Database** which can be :

- **Opensearch** : Can be the same cluster as above, or a separated one
- **Redis Stack** : Redis 5.x\+ with JSON and SEARCH modules, 3-node cluster with 5GB RAM and 2 vCPU each

## Storage and Filesystems

Prisme.ai requires either a file or object storage for models & file uploads :

- **RWX Filesystem**: RWX volume with at least 50GB capacity, attached to a Kubernetes Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)
- **S3-Compatible Storage**
- **Azure Blob Storage**
- **Google Cloud Storage**

### AI Products requirements

AI Products installation also require a **RWX filesystem**

## Networking and DNS

DNS configuration requirements:

- **Wildcard DNS**: Essential for workspace routing (e.g., `*.pages.yourdomain.com`).
- **Dedicated DNS**: Required for API (`api.yourdomain.com`) and Studio (`studio.yourdomain.com`)【40:2†source】.

In case wildcards DNS can't be setup and **AI Products** need to be installed, the following DNS must be created :

- ai-knowledge.pages.yourdomain.com
- ai-knowledge-chat.pages.yourdomain.com
- ops-manager.pages.yourdomain.com
- teams-service.pages.yourdomain.com
- ai-collection.pages.yourdomain.com
- ai-insights.pages.yourdomain.com

However, other custom workspaces won't be able to have their web pages reachable

## Offline environments

### AI Products requirements

AI Products installation in offline environments require  :

- A npm registry reachable from the cluster
- If using internal / self-signed TLS certificates, they must be configured inside almost all microservices to avoid HTTPS errors

See [AI Products requirements](https://docs.prisme.ai/self-hosting/configuration/products-installation#offline-environments) for more details

## Authentication (SSO)

Prisme.ai supports multiple Single Sign-On (SSO) options:

- **OIDC Providers**: Compatible with Google, Azure, and other generic OIDC providers【35:1†source】.
- **SAML Providers**: Supported with HTTP-POST binding (e.g., Okta).
- **Configuration**: Managed via `authProviders.config.yml` for easy integration.

See [SSO configuration documentation](/self-hosting/entreprise/authentication)

## Recommended Load Testing

Before going live, perform tailored load tests considering:

- **Interactions per user**: 4-10 per session.
- **Simultaneous users**: Support for 100 new users per second.
- **API response time**: Target 478 ms P95 for the first token using OpenAI API【32:1†source】.

---

To successfully deploy and manage Prisme.ai within your infrastructure, you need to ensure that your environment meets specific prerequisites related to resources, services, and configurations.

## Infrastructure Recommendations

Prisme.ai recommends the following baseline infrastructure to ensure smooth operation:

- **Nodes**: At least 3 Kubernetes nodes with 4 vCPU and 16GB RAM each【40:1†source】.
- **Disk Space**: Minimum 50GB recommended for persistent storage.
- **High Availability**: Use managed services or clusters with redundancy capabilities.
- **Load Balancer**: Ingress controller or cloud load balancer required for service routing.

## Database Requirements

Ensure the following database setups for optimal performance and reliability:

- **MongoDB**:
  - Version: 6.x or newer
  - Configuration: 3-node replica set, each with at least 2GB RAM, 2 vCPU, and 1,000 IOPS【32:2†source】.

- **Redis**:
  - Version: 5.x or newer
  - Configuration: Separate instances recommended for cache and broker, each with at least 3GB RAM and 2 vCPU【32:2†source】.

- **Elasticsearch/OpenSearch**:
  - Version: 8.x or newer
  - Configuration: 3-node cluster, each node with 8GB RAM and 4 vCPU【32:3†source】.

- **Vector Database (Redis Stack)**:
  - Version: Redis 5.x+ with JSON and SEARCH modules
  - Configuration: 3-node cluster with 5GB RAM and 2 vCPU each【32:3†source】.

## Storage and Filesystems

Prisme.ai supports various storage backends, including:

- **Filesystem**: Kubernetes Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) with RWX support and at least 50GB capacity.
- **S3-Compatible Storage**: Separate buckets for models, uploads, and public content.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Supported as an alternative to S3-compatible storage.

## Networking and DNS

DNS configuration requirements:

- **Wildcard DNS**: Essential for workspace routing (e.g., `*.pages.yourdomain.com`).
- **Dedicated DNS**: Required for API (`api.yourdomain.com`) and Studio (`studio.yourdomain.com`)【40:2†source】.

## Authentication (SSO)

Prisme.ai supports multiple Single Sign-On (SSO) options:

- **OIDC Providers**: Compatible with Google, Azure, and other generic OIDC providers【35:1†source】.
- **SAML Providers**: Supported with HTTP-POST binding (e.g., Okta).
- **Configuration**: Managed via `authProviders.config.yml` for easy integration.

## Environment Variables

Critical variables for Prisme.ai deployment:

- **API_URL, CONSOLE_URL, PAGES_HOST**: Essential URLs for service operation.
- **Database Hosts and Secrets**: Required for Redis, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and others【36:1†source】.
- **Uploads Configuration**: Separate environment variables for managing public and private buckets【36:2†source】.

## Recommended Load Testing

Before going live, perform tailored load tests considering:

- **Interactions per user**: 4-10 per session.
- **Simultaneous users**: Support for 100 new users per second.
- **API response time**: Target 478 ms P95 for the first token using OpenAI API【32:1†source】.

API integrations are a core component of the Prisme.ai Apps Marketplace, enabling your AI solutions to connect with external services and systems. These integrations allow you to incorporate data from other platforms, trigger actions in external systems, and build comprehensive workflows that span multiple services.

## Understanding API Integrations

API integrations on Prisme.ai provide a standardized way to interact with external services:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Simplified Authentication" icon="key">
    Secure credential management without exposing sensitive information
  </Card>
  <Card title="Standardized Interface" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Consistent patterns for interacting with diverse services
  </Card>
  <Card title="Parameter Validation" icon="check-circle">
    Input validation to prevent errors and ensure proper data format
  </Card>
  <Card title="Error Handling" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    Consistent error reporting and recovery mechanisms
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

These features make it easier to connect to external systems without dealing with the complexity of raw API interactions.

## How API Integrations Work

API integrations in Prisme.ai follow a consistent pattern:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authentication Configuration">
    Each API integration requires credentials to access the external service. These are securely stored and managed within the platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Action Definition">
    Integrations expose a set of actions (such as "Send Email" or "Create Contact") that represent operations in the external system.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Parameter Mapping">
    When using an action, you map data from your workflow to the parameters required by the external API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execution">
    The platform handles the API call, including authentication, request formatting, and response processing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Response Handling">
    The response from the external system is parsed and made available to your workflow for further processing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This standardized approach simplifies integration with external systems while maintaining flexibility and control.

## Example: Mailjet Integration

Let's look at an example of an API integration with Mailjet, a popular email service:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Installation">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Access the Marketplace">
        Navigate to the Apps section in your Prisme.ai workspace
      </Step>
      <Step title="Find the Mailjet App">
        Search for "Mailjet" or browse the Communication category
      </Step>
      <Step title="Install the App">
        Click "Install" to add the Mailjet app to your workspace
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure Authentication">
        Enter your Mailjet API Key and Secret Key when prompted
        
        ```
        API_KEY: your_mailjet_api_key
        SECRET_KEY: your_mailjet_secret_key
        ```
        
        These credentials are encrypted and securely stored.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Configuration">
    The Mailjet app provides several configuration options:
    
    ```yaml
    config:
      schema:
        base64_encoded_credentials:
          title: Base64 encoded credentials
          description: Base64 encoded credentials
          type: string
    ```
    
    This configuration schema allows for secure credential storage and management. The credentials are stored in base64 encoded format for additional security.

      <img src="/images/api-config.png" alt="API Configuration" />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Using in Automations">
    Once configured, you can use the Mailjet app in your automations:
    
    ```yaml
    slug: send-email
    name: SendMail
    do:
      - Mailjet.sendMail:
          to: '{{recipient}}'
          replyTo: '{{payload.email}}'
          subject: New Contact Form Submission
          body: 'Message: {{payload.message}}, Name: {{payload.name}}, Attachment: {{payload.attachment}}'
    ```
    
    This example shows an automation that sends an email through Mailjet based on form submission data.

## Building Custom API Integrations

While the marketplace includes many pre-built integrations, you can also create custom API integrations for your specific needs:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Workspace">
    Start by creating a dedicated workspace for your API integration
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define the API Interface">
    Create an automation that encapsulates the API interaction:
    
    ```yaml
    slug: api-action-name
    name: Descriptive Action Name
    do:
      - fetch:
          emitErrors: true
          outputMode: body
          headers:
            Content-Type: application/json
            Authorization: "Bearer {{config.api_token}}"
          url: https://api.example.com/endpoint
          method: post
          body:
            key1: "{{param1}}"
            key2: "{{param2}}"
          output: response
    arguments:
      param1:
        type: string
        title: Parameter 1
        description: Description of parameter 1
      param2:
        type: string
        title: Parameter 2
        description: Description of parameter 2
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Authentication">
    Set up the workspace configuration schema to handle authentication credentials:
    
    ```yaml
    config:
      schema:
        api_token:
          title: API Token
          description: Authentication token for the API
          type: string
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Documentation">
    Add a documentation page to explain how to use your integration:
    
    ```yaml
    slug: _doc
    name:
      fr: Documentation
      en: Documentation
    blocks:
      - slug: RichText
        content: |-
          <h1>API Integration Name</h1> 
          <p>
            Description of what this integration does and how to use it.
          </p>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish as an App">
    Publish your workspace as an app to make it available in your organization's marketplace
  </Step>
</Steps>

This approach allows you to create standardized interfaces for any API, making them available across your organization.

## Authentication Methods

API integrations in Prisme.ai support various authentication methods:

## How Collection Works

Collection provides a MongoDB-compatible interface integrated directly into the Prisme.ai platform:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Collections Organization">
    Data is organized into collections, similar to tables in relational databases:
    - Each collection contains related documents
    - Collections are created automatically when used
    - No schema definition is required
    - Each workspace has its own collection namespace
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document Structure">
    Documents are stored as JSON-like objects:
    - Each document has a unique `_id` field
    - Documents can have any structure
    - Fields can contain various data types
    - Nested objects and arrays are supported
    - Documents in the same collection can have different structures
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Operations">
    Operations are performed through simple, intuitive methods:
    - Commands follow MongoDB syntax and patterns
    - Results are returned in standard formats
    - Operations are executed in a secure environment
    - Performance is optimized for common use cases
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integration">
    Collection integrates with the rest of the Prisme.ai ecosystem:
    - Direct usage in automations
    - Connection to AI agents through tools
    - Data exchange with other platform components
    - Role-based access control
  </Step>
</Steps>

This approach provides the power of a document database with the simplicity of a fully managed service.

## Basic Operations

Let's explore the core operations you can perform with Collection:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Inserting Data">
    Add documents to a collection:
    
    ```yaml
    # Insert a single document
    - Collection.insert:
        data:
          name: "John Doe"
          email: "john.doe@example.com"
          age: 30
          active: true
        output: result
    
    # Insert multiple documents
    - Collection.insertMany:
        data:
          - name: "Jane Smith"
            email: "jane.smith@example.com"
            age: 28
          - name: "Bob Johnson"
            email: "bob.johnson@example.com"
            age: 35
        output: result
    ```
    
    The operation returns information about the inserted documents, including their assigned `_id` values.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Finding Data">
    Retrieve documents from a collection:
    
    ```yaml
    # Find documents matching criteria
    - Collection.find:
        query:
          age: { $gt: 25 }
        output: users
    
    # Find a single document
    - Collection.findOne:
        query:
          email: "john.doe@example.com"
        output: user
    
    # Find + sort + pagination
    - Collection.find:
        query:
          active: true
        sort:
          age: -1  # Descending
        options:
          limit: 10
          skip: 0
        output: activeUsers
    ```
    
    These operations allow you to retrieve documents with precise filtering and control over the results.  
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Updating Data">
    By default, **updates** use mongo `$set` operator to only update given fields without removing other fields already existing in the matched record :  
    ```yaml
    # Update a single document
    - Collection.updateOne:
        query:
          email: "john.doe@example.com"
        data:
          age: 31
          lastUpdated: "{{run.date}}"
        output: updateResult
    ```
    
    But you can also use the MongoDB operators you want :  
    ```yaml
    # Update a single document
    - Collection.updateOne:
        query:
          email: "john.doe@example.com"
        data:
          $set:
            age: 31
            lastUpdated: "{% now() %}"
        output: updateResult
    
    # Update multiple documents
    - Collection.updateMany:
        query:
          active: false
        data:
          $set:
            status: "inactive"
            lastChecked: "{{run.date}}"
        output: updateResult
    
    # Update with advanced operators
    - Collection.updateOne:
        query:
          _id: "{{userId}}"
        data:
          $inc:
            loginCount: 1
          $push:
            loginHistory:
              date: "{{run.date}}"
              ip: "{{userIp}}"
        output: updateResult
    ```
    
    These operations enable precise updates to documents, including field modifications, additions, and array operations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Deleting Data">
    Remove documents from a collection:
    
    ```yaml
    # Delete a single document
    - Collection.deleteOne:
        query:
          email: "john.doe@example.com"
        output: deleteResult
    
    # Delete multiple documents
    - Collection.deleteMany:
        query:
          active: false
          lastLogin: { $lt: "{% dateAdd('now', -90, 'days') %}" }
        output: deleteResult
    ```
    
    These operations allow you to remove documents based on specific criteria.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Aggregation Operations">
    Perform complex data analysis:
    
    ```yaml
    # Aggregate data
    - Collection.find:
        aggregate:
          - $match:
              active: true
          - $group:
              _id: "$department"
              count: { $sum: 1 }
              avgAge: { $avg: "$age" }
              employees: { $push: { name: "$name", email: "$email" } }
          - $sort:
              count: -1
        output: departmentStats
    ```
    
    Aggregation provides powerful data analysis capabilities, including grouping, filtering, and computation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Find pagination">
    Pagination is enforced by returning only the first 50 matching entries by default. This number is configurable with **options.limit**.  
    You can then choose which page you are interested in using **options.page**, starting at **1** for the first page :  
    
    ```yaml
    # First page :  
    - Collection.find:
        query: {}
        options:
          limit: 50
          page: 1
        output: firstPage
    - Collection.find:
        query: {}
        options:
          limit: 50
          page: 2
        output: secondPage        
    ```
    
    Alternatively, you can use **options.skip** to finely select the matching page :  
    ```yaml
    # Retrieve from the 11th to the 51th  record
    - Collection.find:
        query: {}
        options:
          limit: 50
          skip: 10
        output: firstPage
    ```    
  </Accordion>  
</AccordionGroup>

    Design your data structure effectively:
    
    - Use descriptive collection names
    - Choose between embedding and referencing based on access patterns
    - Keep document size reasonable (under 1MB when possible)
    - Normalize data when it changes frequently
    - Denormalize data to optimize common queries
    - Use consistent field names across collections
    
    Effective data modeling improves performance and maintainability.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Query Optimization">
    Optimize your queries for better performance:
    
    - Create indexes for frequently queried fields
    - Write specific queries that use indexes
    - Limit the number of documents returned
    - Avoid complex regex patterns when possible
    - Use aggregation for data processing, not application code
    
    These practices ensure efficient data retrieval.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Data Validation">
    Ensure data quality and consistency:
    
    - Validate input data before storage
    - Consider using schema validation for critical collections
    - Implement application-level validation for complex rules
    - Use unique indexes to prevent duplicates
    - Include creation and update timestamps
    - Maintain audit trails for sensitive data
    
    Validation helps maintain data integrity.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Security Considerations">
    Protect your data with proper security practices:
    
    - Apply proper access controls
    - Validate input to prevent injection attacks
    - Don't store sensitive data without encryption
    - Implement appropriate backup strategies
    - Audit access to sensitive collections
    - Follow the principle of least privilege
    
    Security should be a fundamental consideration in all data operations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limitations and Considerations

When using Collection, be aware of these considerations:

- **Document Size**: Individual documents are limited to 16MB
- **Nested Depth**: Deep nesting of objects can impact performance
- **Query Complexity**: Very complex queries may have performance implications
- **Transaction Limits**: Transactions have time and size limitations
- **Indexing Overhead**: Indexes improve query performance but increase storage requirements and write overhead
- **Consistency Model**: Collection uses an eventually consistent model in some scenarios

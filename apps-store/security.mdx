Security is a critical consideration when integrating external services and data sources with your Prisme.ai environment. This page outlines the security architecture of the Apps Marketplace, explains how credentials and data are protected, and provides best practices for secure integration management.

## Security Architecture Overview

Prisme.ai's Apps Marketplace is built with a security-first approach that protects sensitive information while enabling powerful integrations:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Isolated Execution" icon="lock">
    Apps run in isolated environments with controlled access to resources
  </Card>
  <Card title="Encrypted Credentials" icon="key">
    Authentication details are encrypted at rest and in transit
  </Card>
  <Card title="Granular Permissions" icon="shield">
    Fine-grained access controls determine who can use which apps
  </Card>
  <Card title="Audit Logging" icon="list-check">
    Comprehensive logging of all app installation, configuration, and usage
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Credential Management

The Apps Marketplace includes a secure credential management system that protects authentication information:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Encrypted Storage">
    All credentials (API keys, passwords, tokens, etc.) are encrypted using industry-standard algorithms before being stored
  </Step>
  <Step title="Secure Access">
    Credentials are only accessible to authorized services and users with appropriate permissions
  </Step>
  <Step title="No Plain Text Display">
    Credentials are never displayed in plain text after initial entry, even to administrators
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Rotation">
    Support for automatic credential rotation based on policies or schedules (for compatible services)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Centralized Management">
    Unified interface for managing all integration credentials across the organization
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data Protection

When apps process and transfer data, several protective measures ensure security:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Data in Transit">
    All communication between Prisme.ai and integrated services is protected:
    
    - TLS encryption for all data in transit
    - Certificate validation to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
    - Modern cipher suites and security protocols
    - HTTP security headers for web-based integrations
    
    These measures ensure that data cannot be intercepted or tampered with during transmission.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Data at Rest">
    Information stored within the platform is protected through:
    
    - Encryption of all sensitive data
    - Secure key management
    - Regular security assessments and penetration testing
    - Data minimization practices
    
    The platform applies the principle of least privilege, storing only necessary information and protecting it with appropriate controls.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Data Processing">
    During processing, data is protected through:
    
    - Isolated execution environments
    - Memory protection
    - Controlled access to resources
    - Input validation and output sanitization
    
    These controls prevent unauthorized access to data during processing and protect against injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Access Control Model

The Apps Marketplace implements a comprehensive access control model:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="App Installation Control">
    Organizations can control which apps can be installed:
    
    - Allow or block specific apps
    - Require approval for installation requests
    - Limit installation capabilities to specific roles
    - Create allowlists of approved apps
    
    This ensures that only authorized and approved apps are introduced into the environment.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Usage Permissions">
    Once installed, app usage is controlled through:
    
    - Role-based access controls
    - Workspace-level permissions
    - Function-level authorization
    - Context-based restrictions
    
    These controls determine who can use which aspects of installed apps and under what circumstances.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Configuration Management">
    Access to app configuration is restricted:
    
    - Separate permissions for viewing vs. editing configurations
    - Credential management restricted to authorized administrators
    - Configuration change approval workflows
    - Version control and change tracking
    
    This prevents unauthorized changes to integration settings that could compromise security.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Integration Risk Assessment

When adding new integrations, Prisme.ai helps organizations assess and mitigate risks:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Assessment">
    Evaluate the security posture of the service being integrated:
    - Review security certifications and compliance
    - Assess data handling practices
    - Consider the sensitivity of data being exchanged
  </Step>
  <Step title="Permission Scoping">
    Define the minimum permissions required:
    - Use the principle of least privilege
    - Request only necessary access scopes
    - Limit data access to what's essential
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implementation Review">
    Validate the security of the implementation:
    - Review authentication mechanisms
    - Verify data handling practices
    - Check for appropriate error handling
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ongoing Monitoring">
    Continuously assess integration security:
    - Monitor for unusual activity
    - Regularly review access and usage
    - Update configurations as needs change
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security Best Practices

Follow these recommendations to maintain the security of your app integrations:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Credential Management">
    - Use dedicated API keys for each integration when possible
    - Rotate credentials regularly
    - Implement the most secure authentication method available
    - Use service accounts with minimum necessary permissions
    - Consider using OAuth flows rather than static credentials
    - Store sensitive configuration outside source control
    - Implement API key expiration and rotation policies
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Data Handling">
    - Limit the data exchanged to what's necessary
    - Implement data classification to identify sensitive information
    - Apply appropriate controls based on data sensitivity
    - Use field-level security to protect specific attributes
    - Consider data anonymization or pseudonymization when appropriate
    - Validate and sanitize all data inputs and outputs
    - Apply encryption for highly sensitive data
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitoring and Incident Response">
    - Enable audit logging for all integration activities
    - Set up alerts for unusual access patterns
    - Regularly review integration usage
    - Establish procedures for responding to suspicious activities
    - Create a process for emergency credential revocation
    - Conduct periodic security reviews of integrations
    - Test security incident response plans
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Compliance Considerations">
    - Identify regulatory requirements applicable to your integrations
    - Document compliance controls for each integration
    - Include integrations in security assessments and audits
    - Consider data residency and sovereignty requirements
    - Review vendor contracts and terms of service
    - Maintain data processing agreements when required
    - Update security controls as regulations evolve
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## App Approval Workflow

For organizations requiring strict control over app usage, Prisme.ai provides a configurable approval workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request Submission">
    Users request access to specific apps, providing business justification
  </Step>
  <Step title="Security Review">
    Security teams assess the risks and appropriate controls
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approval Decision">
    Designated approvers review and decide on the request
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implementation">
    Upon approval, the app is installed with appropriate controls
  </Step>
  <Step title="Documentation">
    The approval, including justification and controls, is documented
  </Step>
</Steps>

This process ensures that new integrations are evaluated from a security perspective before being implemented.

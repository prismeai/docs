</Frame>

Each AI SecureChat conversation consists of:

1. **Conversation Title** - A name to identify the conversation
2. **Messages** - The exchange between you and the AI
3. **Context Window** - The amount of previous conversation the AI can reference
4. **Metadata** - Date created, last modified, sharing status, etc.
5. **Associated Resources** - Documents, links, and other referenced materials

## Creating and Managing Conversations

### Starting New Conversations

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new conversation">
    Click the "new chat" button in the conversation sidebar.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/new-conversation-button.png" alt="New Conversation Button" />
    </Frame>

    This starts a fresh conversation with no previous context.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name your conversation">
    Click on the default "New conversation" title to rename it.

    Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the conversation's purpose.
  </Step>

</Steps>

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose sharing options">

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Conversation History and Navigation

</CardGroup>

<Note>

</Note>

## Conversation Context Management

Understanding and managing the conversation context is crucial for effective interactions:

<Accordion title="Context Window Explained">
  The context window represents how much of the previous conversation the AI can access when generating responses.

  Key points:
  - Each model has a maximum context window size
  - Older messages may fall outside the context window in long conversations
  - The AI can only reference content within the current context window
  - Documents and files also consume context space
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Managing Context Effectively">
  Optimize your context use with these techniques:
  
  Best practices:
  - Start new conversations for new topics
  - Summarize long threads to conserve context
  - Use the "Forget earlier messages" option to free up context space
  - Be concise in your questions and instructions
  - Reference specific messages when continuing a previous thread
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Manual Context Control">
  Take direct control of your conversation context when needed by forking the conversation or editing your sent message.

</Accordion>

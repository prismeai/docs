## Your First Conversation

Let's start a basic conversation with AI SecureChat:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ask a question">
    Type a question or request in the input box and press Enter or click the send button.

    Example questions to get started:

    - "Can you help me draft an email to my team about our upcoming project deadline?"
    - "Summarize the key points about Retrieval Augmented Generation."
    - "What are some best practices for effective virtual meetings?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the response">
    The AI will generate a response based on your question. The response will appear in the message area.

    You'll see the response appear in real-time as it's being generated.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Continue the conversation">
    Follow up with additional questions or requests. AI SecureChat maintains context throughout your conversation.

    Example follow-ups:

    - "Can you make that more concise?"
    - "Add a section about [specific topic]."
    - "Rewrite this in a more formal tone."
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Working with Documents

One of AI SecureChat's powerful features is the ability to analyze documents:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload a document">
    Click the upload button (üìé) next to the input box and select a document from your computer.

    <Frame>
      ![AISC Uploadbutton Pn](/images/AISCUploadbutton.png)
    </Frame>
    <Frame>
      ![Uploading a Document](/images/upload-document.png)
    </Frame>
    Supported formats include PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, text files, and images with text.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for processing">
    The document will be uploaded and processed. This may take a few moments depending on the document size.

    You'll see a progress indicator while the document is being processed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask questions about the document">
    Once processing is complete, you can ask questions specifically about the document content.

    Example document questions:

    - "Summarize the main points of this document."
    - "What are the key findings in the results section?"
    - "Extract the action items from this meeting note."
    - "What data is shown in the table on page 3?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Conversations

Keep your AI SecureChat experience organized:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name your conversation">
    Click on the default conversation name ("New conversation") at the top of the message area to rename it.

    Use descriptive names that help you identify the conversation topic.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start a new conversation">
    Click the "\+" button in the conversation sidebar to start a fresh conversation.

    Starting a new conversation clears the context from previous interactions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access conversation history">
    Browse your previous conversations using the sidebar navigation.

    Conversations are automatically saved and can be accessed according to your organization's retention policies.
  </Step>

    Depending on your organization's settings, deleted conversations may be recoverable for a certain period.
  </Step>
</Steps>

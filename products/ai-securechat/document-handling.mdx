## Uploading Documents

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the upload function">
    Click the upload button (üìé) in the message input area.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/document-upload-button.png" alt="Document Upload Button" />
    </Frame>
    
    Alternatively, you can drag and drop files directly into the chat area.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select documents">
    Choose one or more files from your computer in the file selection dialog.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/file-selection-dialog.png" alt="File Selection Dialog" />
    </Frame>
    
    You can select multiple files by holding Ctrl (or Cmd on Mac) while clicking, or select a range with Shift.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for processing">
    The documents will be uploaded and processed. A progress indicator will show status.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/document-processing-progress.png" alt="Document Processing Progress" />
    </Frame>
    
    Processing time varies based on:
    - Document size and complexity
    - Number of pages
    - Document format
    - Current system load
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify successful upload">
    Once processing is complete, you'll see the document(s) displayed in the conversation.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/document-uploaded.png" alt="Document Successfully Uploaded" />
    </Frame>
    
    The AI will typically acknowledge that it can now answer questions about the document.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Document Size and Quantity Limits

Be aware of the following limitations when working with documents:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Limitation</th>
      <th>Default Value</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Maximum file size</td>
      <td>50MB per file</td>
      <td>For optimal performance, keep files under 20MB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Maximum pages</td>
      <td>300 pages per document</td>
      <td>Longer documents may be truncated</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Files per upload</td>
      <td>10 files simultaneously</td>
      <td>Can upload additional files in subsequent actions</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Files per conversation</td>
      <td>25 files</td>
      <td>Consider starting a new conversation for additional files</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Note>
  These limits may vary based on your organization's Prisme.ai configuration. Contact your administrator for specific limitations in your environment.

## Analyzing Documents

Once your document is uploaded, you can interact with it in several ways:

### Basic Document Questions

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/document-basic-questions.png" alt="Basic Document Questions" />
</Frame>

Common question types:
Summarize this document in 3 paragraphs.
What are the key points on page 5?
Extract all the tables from this document.
List all the action items mentioned in the meeting minutes.
Copy
### Advanced Document Analysis

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/document-advanced-analysis.png" alt="Advanced Document Analysis" />
</Frame>

More sophisticated requests:
Compare the financial projections in Q1 versus Q3 from this report.
What trends do you notice in the customer feedback data?
Identify potential risks mentioned throughout the document and suggest mitigation strategies.
Extract and organize the technical specifications into a structured format.
Copy
### Working with Multiple Documents

## Document Management in Conversations

Manage documents within your conversations for optimal organization:

<Steps>
  <Step title="View document list">
    Click the "Documents" tab in the sidebar to see all documents in the current conversation.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/document-list.png" alt="Document List" />
    </Frame>
    
    The list shows document names, types, and upload times.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Focus on specific documents">
    To direct the AI to focus on particular documents, you can use the document selector:
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/document-selector.png" alt="Document Selector" />
    </Frame>
    
    Select one or more documents to limit the AI's focus to just those documents.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Remove documents">
    To remove a document from the conversation:
    
    1. Navigate to the Documents tab
    2. Hover over the document you want to remove
    3. Click the delete icon (üóëÔ∏è)
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/remove-document.png" alt="Removing a Document" />
    </Frame>
    
    Removed documents will no longer be accessible for analysis in the conversation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting Document Issues

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Document fails to upload">
  If your document fails to upload:
  
  - Check that the file size is within limits
  - Verify the file format is supported
  - Ensure the file isn't corrupted (try opening it in another application)
  - Check your network connection
  - Try converting the document to PDF if it's in a less common format
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Document processing takes too long">
  If processing seems to be taking excessive time:
  
  - For large documents (>50 pages), some processing time is normal
  - Try refreshing the conversation if it appears to be stuck
  - Consider breaking very large documents into smaller files
  - Close other browser tabs to free up resources
  - Check if the document contains complex elements (large tables, many images)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Text recognition issues">
  If the AI has trouble recognizing text in documents:
  
  - For scanned documents, ensure they are clear and high-resolution
  - If using OCR on images, check that text is clearly visible
  - Try rotating images to the correct orientation
  - For handwritten content, be aware that recognition may be limited
  - Consider pre-processing scanned documents with dedicated OCR software
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="AI misinterprets document content">
  If the AI misunderstands or misrepresents document content:
  
  - Provide more specific questions about the document
  - Ask the AI to cite the specific sections it's referring to
  - For complex documents, guide the AI through the document structure
  - Try asking for a straightforward summary first before detailed analysis
  - For technical content, explicitly ask the AI to focus on specific terminology

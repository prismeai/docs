AI SecureChat's multimodal capabilities allow you to work with images and visual content alongside text, creating a more comprehensive and powerful AI experience. This guide explores how to leverage these capabilities effectively.

## Understanding Multimodal AI

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="What is Multimodal AI?">
    Multimodal AI can process and understand multiple types of information (modalities), including:
    
    - Text (natural language)
    - Images and video
    - Audio and speech
    - Charts and diagrams
    - Structured data
    
    This allows for more comprehensive understanding and analysis across different forms of content.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Supported Modalities">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/supported-modalities.png" alt="Supported Modalities" />
    </Frame>
    
    AI SecureChat currently supports:
    
    - **Text** - Natural language in multiple languages
    - **Images** - Photos, diagrams, screenshots, illustrations
    - **Documents** - PDFs, presentations, reports with visual elements
    - **Charts and Graphs** - Data visualizations
    - **Screenshots** - Software interfaces and digital content
    
    <Note>
      Support for audio and video modalities may be available depending on your organization's configuration and the AI models being used.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Model Requirements">
    
    Multimodal capabilities require specific AI models:
    
    - Not all language models support multimodal inputs
    - Your organization's Prisme.ai configuration determines which models are available
    - Models with multimodal support will be indicated in the model selector
    - Performance may vary between different multimodal models
    
    Check with your administrator if you're unsure which models in your environment support multimodal features.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Working with Images

### Uploading Images

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access image upload">
    Click the upload button (ðŸ“Ž) in the message input area and select an image, or drag and drop an image directly into the chat.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/image-upload.png" alt="Image Upload in AI SecureChat" />
    </Frame>
    
    Supported image formats include:
    - PNG
    - JPEG/JPG
    - GIF (static)
    - WebP
    - BMP
    - SVG (as an image; code parsing may be limited)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add context (optional)">
    After uploading an image, you can provide additional context or specific questions about the image.
    
    Providing context can help guide the AI's analysis and generate more relevant responses.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit for analysis">
    Send your message with the image to have the AI process and analyze it.

    
    The AI will acknowledge the image and provide an initial response based on its content.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting Multimodal Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Image not being processed">
    If the AI doesn't properly analyze your image:
    
    - Check that you're using a multimodal-capable model
    - Verify the image format is supported
    - Ensure the image isn't too large (try compressing)
    - Check that the image uploaded completely
    - Try describing what's in the image as context
    - For complex images, try focusing on specific parts
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Poor image analysis quality">
    If image analysis results are inaccurate or vague:
    
    - Improve image quality (resolution, lighting, focus)
    - Try a different multimodal model if available
    - Be more specific in your prompts
    - For text extraction, ensure text is clear and readable
    - For charts, make sure data points and labels are visible
    - Try cropping the image to focus on the relevant part
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Audio processing issues">
    If audio isn't being transcribed correctly:
    
    - Check audio quality and reduce background noise if possible
    - Verify the audio format is supported
    - Try shorter audio segments for complex recordings
    - Provide context about speakers, topic, or terminology
    - For non-English audio, specify the language
    - Try a model specifically optimized for audio if available
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Image generation not working">
    If you can't generate images or results are poor:
    
    - Verify your model supports image generation
    - Check if generation features are enabled in your instance
    - Be more specific and detailed in your description
    - Break complex images into simpler requests
    - Try different styles or approaches
    - Be aware of content policy restrictions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Privacy and Security Considerations

<Warning>
  When working with multimodal content, be mindful of:
  
  - **Personal Information**: Avoid uploading images or audio with personally identifiable information (PII) unless necessary and permitted by your organization's policies.
  
  - **Confidential Content**: Consider the sensitivity of visual information in screenshots, diagrams, or documents.
  
  - **Consent**: Ensure you have appropriate permissions when uploading media that includes other people, especially for audio recordings of conversations or meetings.
  
  - **Data Retention**: Understand your organization's policies regarding how long uploaded media is retained in the system.
</Warning>

Prisme.ai implements several security measures for multimodal content:

<CheckList>
  <Check>End-to-end encryption for all uploaded media</Check>
  <Check>Configurable content filtering and moderation</Check>
  <Check>Temporary storage with controlled retention periods</Check>
  <Check>Access controls based on user permissions</Check>
  <Check>Audit logging of all multimodal operations</Check>
  <Check>Optional PII detection and redaction</Check>
</CheckList>

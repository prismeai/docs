# Evaluating Conversations in AI Insights

Use AI Insights‚Äô conversation evaluation feature to collect structured feedback on your assistant‚Äôs interactions. You can define custom evaluation criteria, fill them automatically or manually, and enable the evaluation pipeline on new conversations.

---

## 1. Overview

The evaluation form lets you specify exactly **what** and **how** to evaluate for each conversation:

- **Purpose**: Gather consistent, structured assessments of assistant replies.
- **Use cases**: Quality control, performance tracking, fine‚Äêtuning data collection.
- **Modes**:
  - **Automatic**: Every new conversation is evaluated by a large language model (LLM) against your schema.
  - **Manual**: Reviewers fill in the form via the UI, optionally assisted by the LLM.

---

## 2. Configuring the Evaluation Form

AI Insights uses a [**custom JSON Schema defintion**](/products/ai-builder/workspaces) for your form.
You can describe each field‚Äôs:

- **Key** (JSON property name)
- **Type** (`boolean`, `string`, `array`, etc.)
- **Title** and **Description** (guidance for the evaluator)
- **Enum** or **Choices** for list selections

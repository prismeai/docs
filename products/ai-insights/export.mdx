title: "Exporting data"
description: "All your conversations can be exported at any time."

In your conversation list, an "Export" button allows you to export the currently filtered data. If the current dataset contains more than 1,000 items, exporting will not be possible and you will need to refine your filter (by setting a shorter period, for example, or selecting single lines).

Keep in mind the filters are applied on conversations, not messages. If you ask to export data from septembre 1 to septembre 2, it will contain a conversation created at septembre 1 with a message added on september 3 but it will not include a conversation created at august 31 even if it has a message added on september 1.

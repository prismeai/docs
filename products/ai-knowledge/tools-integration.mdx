description: "Enhance your knowledge agents with powerful tools to extend their capabilities beyond information retrieval"
---

Tools transform your knowledge agents from passive information providers into active problem solvers. By integrating specialized capabilities, your agents can perform tasks, retrieve real-time data, make calculations, and connect to enterprise systemsâ€”all while maintaining the conversational experience users expect.

## What Are Tools?

In Prisme.ai, tools are specialized functions that extend an agent's capabilities beyond retrieving and presenting information from your knowledge base. They allow agents to:

## Creating Custom Tools

You can create custom tools to address specific needs in your organization:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Tool Requirements">
    Determine what the tool should do and how it should interact with users and systems.

    Consider:

    - What problem does this tool solve?
    - What inputs will it need?
    - What outputs should it provide?
    - Which systems will it interact with?
    - What security considerations are important?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Tool Type">
    Choose the most appropriate tool type based on your requirements.

    Tool selection guidance:

    - Use native tools for common functions
    - Choose custom code for specialized logic
    - Select API connectors for external service integration
    - Use webhooks for complex process orchestration
    - Implement database tools for structured data queries
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure or Develop the Tool">
    Set up the tool's parameters or develop its code.

    For custom development:

    - Create clear input/output schemas
    - Implement robust error handling
    - Ensure appropriate security measures
    - Test with various input scenarios
    - Document the tool's functionality
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the Tool">
    Verify that the tool works as expected in different scenarios.

    Testing should include:

    - Basic functionality verification
    - Edge case handling
    - Performance assessment
    - Security testing
    - Integration testing with agent
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to Your Agent">
    Integrate the tool with your knowledge agents.

    During integration:

    - Provide clear tool descriptions
    - Configure when the tool should be used
    - Set appropriate permissions
    - Define error handling behavior
    - Test the agent with the new tool
  </Step>
</Steps>

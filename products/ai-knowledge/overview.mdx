## RAG Overview

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/rag-overview.png" alt="RAG Overview" />
</Frame>

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is the core technology behind AI Knowledge:

<Accordion title="What is RAG?">
  RAG combines retrieval systems with generative AI to produce responses grounded in specific knowledge:
  
  1. A user query is processed to understand the information need
  2. Relevant documents or passages are retrieved from knowledge bases
  3. Retrieved information is provided as context to the language model
  4. The model generates a response that incorporates this specific knowledge
  
  This approach ensures AI responses are:
  - Grounded in accurate, up-to-date information
  - Specific to your organization's context
  - Properly attributed to sources
  - Less prone to hallucination or fabrication
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Benefits of RAG">
  Using RAG through AI Knowledge provides several advantages:
  
  - **Knowledge Recency**: Access the latest information, beyond the model's training cutoff
  - **Factual Grounding**: Base responses on verified organizational knowledge
  - **Reduced Hallucinations**: Minimize fabricated or incorrect information
  - **Domain Specificity**: Provide expertise in your organization's unique areas
  - **Source Attribution**: Trace responses back to specific documents and sources
  - **Knowledge Control**: Determine exactly what information the AI can access and use
  - **Compliance Support**: Ensure responses adhere to organizational policies and standards
</Accordion>

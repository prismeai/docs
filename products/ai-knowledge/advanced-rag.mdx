# Advanced RAG

While basic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is powerful for many use cases, complex knowledge scenarios often require more sophisticated approaches. Advanced RAG architectures address challenges such as multi-step reasoning, diverse information types, and specialized domain knowledge.

## Beyond Basic RAG

Standard RAG has limitations in certain scenarios:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Complex Reasoning" icon="brain">
    Questions requiring multi-step analysis or inference
  </Card>
  <Card title="Large Document Sets" icon="database">
    Knowledge bases with millions of documents or fragments
  </Card>
  <Card title="Diverse Information Types" icon="layer-group">
    Heterogeneous data including structured and unstructured content
  </Card>
  <Card title="Domain-Specific Nuances" icon="microscope">
    Technical fields with specialized terminology and concepts
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Turn Conversations" icon="comments">
    Discussions that build on previous interactions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dynamic Information" icon="bolt">
    Content that changes frequently or requires real-time updates
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Advanced RAG architectures address these challenges through specialized retrieval strategies, context processing techniques, and generation approaches.

## Advanced RAG Architectures

Prisme.ai supports several advanced RAG architectures that you can implement based on your specific needs:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Multi-Stage Retrieval">
    A sequential approach that refines retrieval results through multiple phases.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/multi-stage-retrieval.png" alt="Multi-Stage Retrieval Architecture" />
    </Frame>
    
    <Properties>
      <Property name="Key Components">
        - Initial broad retrieval stage
        - One or more refinement stages
        - Final re-ranking and selection
      </Property>
      <Property name="Ideal For">
        - Large document collections
        - Ambiguous or complex queries
        - High precision requirements
      </Property>
      <Property name="Implementation Complexity" value="Medium" />
    </Properties>
    
    **How It Works**:
    1. First stage performs efficient but less precise retrieval (e.g., BM25 keyword search)
    2. Second stage applies more intensive semantic filtering on first-stage results
    3. Final stage re-ranks candidates using cross-encoders or other precise methods
    4. Only the highest quality content is passed to the LLM
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Recursive Retrieval">
    An iterative approach that breaks down complex queries and retrieves information in stages.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/recursive-retrieval.png" alt="Recursive Retrieval Architecture" />
    </Frame>
    
    <Properties>
      <Property name="Key Components">
        - Query decomposition
        - Sub-query execution
        - Information synthesis
      </Property>
      <Property name="Ideal For">
        - Multi-part questions
        - Complex reasoning scenarios
        - Research-oriented queries
      </Property>
      <Property name="Implementation Complexity" value="High" />
    </Properties>
    
    **How It Works**:
    1. Complex query is broken down into simpler sub-questions
    2. Each sub-question is processed through its own retrieval cycle
    3. Results from sub-questions are collected and synthesized
    4. Final answer incorporates information from all retrieval paths
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Hypothetical Document Embeddings">
    An approach that generates ideal "hypothetical" documents before retrieval to improve query understanding.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/hypothetical-document-embeddings.png" alt="Hypothetical Document Embeddings Architecture" />
    </Frame>
    
    <Properties>
      <Property name="Key Components">
        - Query-to-document expansion
        - Enhanced query representation
        - Semantic matching
      </Property>
      <Property name="Ideal For">
        - Domain-specific knowledge
        - Terminology gaps
        - Intent clarification
      </Property>
      <Property name="Implementation Complexity" value="Medium" />
    </Properties>
    
    **How It Works**:
    1. LLM expands the user's query into a hypothetical "ideal document" that would answer it
    2. This expanded representation is embedded and used for retrieval
    3. The approach bridges terminology gaps between queries and documents
    4. Retrieved documents better match the user's actual intent
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Knowledge Graph RAG">
    Integrates structured knowledge graphs with traditional document retrieval.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/knowledge-graph-rag.png" alt="Knowledge Graph RAG Architecture" />
    </Frame>
    
    <Properties>
      <Property name="Key Components">
        - Knowledge graph navigation
        - Entity and relationship linking
        - Combined structured/unstructured retrieval
      </Property>
      <Property name="Ideal For">
        - Highly connected information
        - Entity-centric domains
        - Reasoning about relationships
      </Property>
      <Property name="Implementation Complexity" value="High" />
    </Properties>
    
    **How It Works**:
    1. Identifies entities and relationships in the user query
    2. Navigates a knowledge graph to find relevant entities and connections
    3. Retrieves both structured data (from the graph) and unstructured content (from documents)
    4. Provides context that includes both factual relationships and detailed explanations
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Self-Reflective RAG">
    Incorporates reasoning and self-critique to improve retrieval quality.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/self-reflective-rag.png" alt="Self-Reflective RAG Architecture" />
    </Frame>
    
    <Properties>
      <Property name="Key Components">
        - Initial retrieval and reasoning
        - Self-critique of results
        - Refinement iterations
      </Property>
      <Property name="Ideal For">
        - Critical information needs
        - Complex reasoning tasks
        - High-stakes applications
      </Property>
      <Property name="Implementation Complexity" value="High" />
    </Properties>
    
    **How It Works**:
    1. Performs initial retrieval and drafts a response
    2. Evaluates its own response for gaps, contradictions, or uncertainties
    3. Identifies additional information needed to address issues
    4. Conducts focused retrieval to fill those gaps
    5. Revises the response based on complete information
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Advanced Context Processing

Beyond retrieval architectures, sophisticated methods for processing retrieved context can significantly improve response quality:

<AccordionGroup>

    - Supports reasoning about relationships
    - Facilitates domain-specific understanding
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Multi-Agent RAG Systems

For particularly complex knowledge applications, multiple specialized agents can work together:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/multi-agent-rag.png" alt="Multi-Agent RAG System" />
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Query Analysis">
    A specialized agent analyzes the user's question to determine required knowledge and approach.
    
    Functions include:
    - Intent identification
    - Domain classification
    - Complexity assessment
    - Subtask identification
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Knowledge Retrieval">
    Multiple specialized retrieval agents gather information from different sources.

    Key responsibilities:
    - Resolving contradictions
    - Organizing information logically
    - Identifying information gaps
    - Creating unified context
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Response Generation">
    A specialized generation agent creates the final response based on synthesized information.
    
    Focus areas:
    - Appropriate format and style
    - Clear explanation logic
    - Accurate source attribution
    - Addressing all aspects of the query
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Self-Reflection">
    A critic agent reviews the response for quality and improvement opportunities.
    
    Assessment criteria:
    - Factual accuracy
    - Comprehensiveness
    - Clarity and coherence
    - Appropriate detail level
  </Step>
</Steps>

Each agent focuses on its specialized task, creating a more robust system than any single agent could provide.

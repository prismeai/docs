## Document Organization

Effective document organization improves retrieval quality and knowledge base maintenance:

<Accordion title="Tagging System">

  Apply flexible tags to documents to filter on these during queries.
  - On each document, you can specify its tags
  - You can use these tags:
    - Automatically, in AI > Self Query > Enabled, so the AI dynamically choose which tags to use for a query
    - Set by the user, In AI > Self Query > Enabled by the user. This will then enable adding tags using the new "+" button that will appear
      in the AI Store.
    - Set mandatory tags for user or groups, in the User sharing page.

  The tags set in the "mandatory" section per user/group operate as an AND with any other tag. If multiple tags are
selected from the user input, they operate as an OR together.

  The tags selected by the user in the AI Store can be used by any other custom tool, with the value stored in the `metadata.aikTags` field
</Accordion>

## LLM-Based Document Analysis

AI Knowledge can process documents, images, and audio files using Language Models for intelligent text extraction beyond traditional parsing methods.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Overview">
    LLM analysis provides intelligent content extraction for different file types:

    | File Type | Behavior | Use Cases |
    |-----------|----------|-----------|
    | **Images** | Always uses LLM (automatic) | Scene descriptions, chart/diagram data extraction, infographic analysis |
    | **Audio** | Always uses LLM (automatic) | Speech transcription from MP3/WAV files |
    | **Documents** | LLM when `parser=llm` | Complex layouts, preserving document structure, OCR on embedded images |

    Images and audio bypass the project parser setting and always use LLM analysis (auto-detected by mimetype). The `parser` configuration only affects document files (PDF, DOCX, etc.): documents are still parsed with `tika` / `unstructured` when selected, but only `parser=llm` uses an LLM.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Processing Pipeline">
    The LLM analysis follows a three-phase flow (parse → embed → query):

    **1. Parsing Phase**
    - Images: LLM generates a text description → stored as `document.text` (original URL in `source.url`)
    - Audio: LLM generates a text transcript → stored as `document.text` (original URL in `source.url`)
    - Documents (`parser: llm`): LLM extracts text (Markdown) → stored as `document.text` (original URL in `source.url`)
    - Documents (`parser: tika` / `unstructured`): the selected parser extracts text (OCR variants are available in the UI) → stored as `document.text` (original URL in `source.url`)

    **2. Embedding Phase**
    - Extracted text is chunked according to project settings
    - Each chunk is converted to vector embeddings
    - Vectors are indexed for semantic search

    **3. Query Phase**
    - User queries retrieve relevant chunks via vector search
    - For capable models, original files can be injected alongside text context (`retrieveSourceDocumentsBase64`)
    - If the model lacks the required capability, only text is sent (no file injection)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Configuration">
    Configure fallback models and capabilities:

    **Workspace Config (`config` in `index.yml`)**
    ```yaml
    config:
      defaultModels:
        parsing:
          image: gpt-5    # Model for image analysis
          audio: gpt-5    # Model for audio transcription
          file: gpt-5     # Model for document extraction
    ```

    **Model Specifications (`modelsSpecifications`)**
    ```yaml
    modelsSpecifications:
      gpt-5:
        capabilities:
          vision:
            enabled: true
          audio:
            enabled: true
          file:
            enabled: true
            maxSize: 20000000  # Max file size in bytes
    ```

    **UI Configuration**

    - Project default: **AI Knowledge > Project > Advanced > Tools > Documents parsing**
    - Per-document override: **AI Knowledge > Project > AI > Text Splitter > Enable override by document**
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="API Usage">
    Specify the parser when uploading documents via API:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST 'https://{env}.prisme.ai/api/workspaces/{workspaceId}/webhooks/document?projectId={projectId}' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'knowledge-project-apikey: YOUR_API_KEY' \
      -d '{
        "name": "Complex Report.pdf",
        "content": { "url": "https://example.com/file.pdf" },
        "parser": "llm"
      }'
    ```

    **Parser Values**

    | Value | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | `project` | Use project default settings |
    | `tika` | Background analysis (fast, text-focused) |
    | `unstructured` | Structure analysis (preserves layout) |
    | `llm` | AI-based analysis (uses LLM) |

    `parser: "llm"` only applies when uploading via URL or file. If you provide `content.text` directly, no parsing occurs (text is already extracted).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Parser Comparison

| Aspect | LLM Parser | Tika / Unstructured |
|--------|------------|---------------------|
| **Speed** | Slower (API calls) | Fast (local processing) |
| **Cost** | Token-based pricing | Free / lower cost |
| **Complex layouts** | Excellent | Limited |
| **Scanned documents** | Built-in OCR | Requires preprocessing |
| **Images/Audio** | Full support | Text extraction only |
| **Structure preservation** | Intelligent | Rule-based |

### Limitations

- **Audio formats**: Only MP3 and WAV are supported
- **File size**: Limited by the model’s `capabilities.file.maxSize` (default ~20MB)
- **Token costs**: Large documents consume significant tokens
- **Processing time**: Slower than traditional parsers
- **Model availability**: Requires a configured model with the required capability (`vision`, `audio`, or `file`)

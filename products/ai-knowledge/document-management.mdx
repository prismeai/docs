  - You can use these tags:
    - Automatically, in AI > Self Query > Enabled, so the AI dynamically choose which tags to use for a query
    - Set by the user, In AI > Self Query > Enabled by the user. This will then enable adding tags using the new "+" button that will appear
      in the AI Store.
    - Set mandatory tags for user or groups, in the User sharing page.

  The tags set in the "mandatory" section per user/group operate as an AND with any other tag. If multiple tags are
selected from the user input, they operate as an OR together.

  The tags selected by the user in the AI Store can be used by any other custom tool, with the value stored in the `metadata.aikTags` field

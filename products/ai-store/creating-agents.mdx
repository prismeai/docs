<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent not using knowledge base properly">
    If your agent isn't accessing or using connected knowledge effectively:
    
    - Verify the knowledge base connections are properly configured
    - Check that the system instructions explicitly mention using the knowledge
    - Test with specific queries that should trigger knowledge retrieval
    - Ensure the knowledge base content is properly formatted and indexed
    - Adjust knowledge retrieval parameters in advanced settings
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tools not being invoked">
    If your agent isn't using tools as expected:
    
    - Check that tools are properly enabled and configured
    - Verify the agent has permission to use the tools
    - Update system instructions to explicitly mention tool usage
    - Test with clear queries that should trigger specific tools
    - Check tool API endpoints and connections
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Response quality issues">
    If your agent's responses aren't meeting quality expectations:
    
    - Adjust the model and temperature settings
    - Enhance system instructions with specific quality guidelines
    - Provide more examples in the preloaded context
    - Connect additional relevant knowledge sources
    - Test with different prompt formulations
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Publishing errors">
    If you encounter errors when trying to publish your agent:
    
    - Check for missing required fields in the configuration
    - Verify that all connected resources (knowledge bases, tools) are accessible
    - Ensure the agent name is unique within your instance
    - Check your permissions for publishing agents
    - Try publishing with more limited visibility settings first

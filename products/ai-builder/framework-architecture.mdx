AI Builder is built on a modern, event-driven architecture that enables scalable, flexible, and maintainable AI applications. This page explains the core architectural principles and components that power the platform.

## Three-Tier Architecture

AI Builder follows a classic three-tier architecture pattern, modernized for cloud-native, event-driven applications:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Presentation Tier">
    The UI layer that users interact with, built using:

    - **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and optimal performance
    - **React**: For component-based UI development
    - **BlockProtocol.org Components**: For standardized UI building blocks
    - **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design

    This tier consists of Pages and Blocks in the AI Builder interface.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Application Tier">
    The business logic layer that processes data and orchestrates workflows:

    - **Event Processing Engine**: For handling asynchronous operations
    - **API Gateway**: For external system integration
    - **Runtime**: For automation runtime

    This tier is represented by Automations in the AI Builder interface.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Data Tier">
    The storage layer that maintains state and persists information:

    - **Memory Stores**: For session, user, and global variables
    - **Event Log**: For activity tracking and debugging
    - **Vector Databases**: For AI knowledge storage (with AI Knowledge)
    - **Relational Databases**: For structured data (with AI Collection)

    This tier is accessed through variables and specialized apps.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

AI Builder's core interaction model is built around events, enabling loose coupling and asynchronous communication between components:

    </Card>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Event Flow in AI Builder

<Steps>
  <Step title="Event Emission">
    Events can originate from multiple sources:

    - UI components (blocks) emitting user interaction events
    - Pages emitting lifecycle and navigation events
    - Automations emitting custom process events
    - External systems emitting webhook events
  </Step>
  <Step title="Event Routing">
    The event router determines where events should be delivered:

    - UI events are routed to relevant automations
    - Automation events may be routed to other automations
    - System events are routed to appropriate handlers
    - Events can be filtered and transformed during routing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Event Handling">
    Recipients process events according to their type:

    - Blocks may update their display based on received events
    - Pages may navigate or modify their structure
    - Automations execute logic sequences in response to events
    - System components update state or perform operations
  </Step>
  <Step title="Event Logging">
    All events are recorded in the Activity log:

    - Event metadata (timestamp, source, type)
    - Event payload (data content)
    - Correlation information (related events)
    - Processing results and any errors
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Microservices Architecture

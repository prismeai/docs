AI Builder is built on a modern, event-driven architecture that enables scalable, flexible, and maintainable AI applications. This page explains the core architectural principles and components that power the platform.

## Three-Tier Architecture

AI Builder follows a classic three-tier architecture pattern, modernized for cloud-native, event-driven applications:


<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Presentation Tier">
    The UI layer that users interact with, built using:
    
    - **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and optimal performance
    - **React**: For component-based UI development
    - **BlockProtocol.org Components**: For standardized UI building blocks
    - **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design
    
    This tier consists of Pages and Blocks in the AI Builder interface.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Application Tier">
    The business logic layer that processes data and orchestrates workflows:
    
    - **Event Processing Engine**: For handling asynchronous operations
    - **API Gateway**: For external system integration
    - **Runtime**: For automation runtime
    
    This tier is represented by Automations in the AI Builder interface.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Data Tier">
    The storage layer that maintains state and persists information:
    
    - **Memory Stores**: For session, user, and global variables
    - **Event Log**: For activity tracking and debugging
    - **Vector Databases**: For AI knowledge storage (with AI Knowledge)
    - **Relational Databases**: For structured data (with AI Collection)
    
    This tier is accessed through variables and specialized apps.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

AI Builder's core interaction model is built around events, enabling loose coupling and asynchronous communication between components:


### Key Components of the EDA

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Event Types">
    <Properties>
      <Property name="System Events" value="Platform-generated events for key operations">
        Examples: page load, block mount, automation start/end, error occurrence
      </Property>
      <Property name="Custom Events" value="User-defined events for application-specific logic">
        Examples: form submission, data request, process completion
      </Property>
      <Property name="UI Events" value="User interaction events from blocks and pages">
        Examples: button click, selection change, data input
      </Property>
      <Property name="External Events" value="Webhooks and API calls from outside systems">
        Examples: third-party notifications, scheduled triggers, external system callbacks
      </Property>
    </Properties>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Event Communication Channels">
    <Properties>
      <Property name="WebSocket" value="Real-time communication between frontend and backend">
        Used for: UI updates, event streaming, long-running processes
      </Property>
      <Property name="HTTP" value="Request-response communication for APIs">
        Used for: External system integration, data fetching, authentication
      </Property>
      <Property name="Event Broker" value="Internal communication between automations">
        Default implementation: Redis Streams for reliable, ordered event delivery
      </Property>
    </Properties>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Event Processing">
    <Properties>
      <Property name="Synchronous Processing" value="Immediate handling with response">
        Used for: Direct API calls, user-facing operations requiring immediate feedback
      </Property>
      <Property name="Asynchronous Processing" value="Queued handling without waiting">
        Used for: Background tasks, long-running operations, scheduled processes
      </Property>
      <Property name="Event Correlation" value="Tracking related events across the system">
        Implementation: Correlation IDs to trace event chains through the system
      </Property>
    </Properties>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Event Flow in AI Builder

<Steps>
  <Step title="Event Emission">
    Events can originate from multiple sources:
    
    - UI components (blocks) emitting user interaction events
    - Pages emitting lifecycle and navigation events
    - Automations emitting custom process events
    - External systems emitting webhook events
    
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Event Routing">
    The event router determines where events should be delivered:
    
    - UI events are routed to relevant automations
    - Automation events may be routed to other automations
    - System events are routed to appropriate handlers
    - Events can be filtered and transformed during routing

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Event Handling">
    Recipients process events according to their type:
    
    - Blocks may update their display based on received events
    - Pages may navigate or modify their structure
    - Automations execute logic sequences in response to events
    - System components update state or perform operations

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Event Logging">
    All events are recorded in the Activity log:
    
    - Event metadata (timestamp, source, type)
    - Event payload (data content)
    - Correlation information (related events)
    - Processing results and any errors

  </Step>
</Steps>

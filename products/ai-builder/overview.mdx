## Getting Started with AI Builder

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Workspace">
    Start by creating a new workspace or selecting from available templates.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/create-workspace.png" alt="Creating a Workspace" />
    </Frame>
    
    A workspace is your dedicated environment for building and connecting all your AI components. It includes:
    - Pages for user interfaces
    - Blocks for reusable UI components
    - Automations for backend logic
    - Activity logs for monitoring and debugging
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Design User Interfaces">
    Create pages by assembling blocks that users will interact with.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/design-ui.png" alt="Designing User Interfaces" />
    </Frame>
    
    Pages are built by:
    - Selecting from pre-built blocks
    - Arranging them in a layout
    - Configuring their properties
    - Connecting them to automations via events
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Build Automations">
    Create backend logic to process data and connect to systems.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/build-automations.png" alt="Building Automations" />
    </Frame>
    
    Automations can be triggered by:
    - User interactions via events
    - HTTP requests to create APIs
    - Scheduled tasks using cron expressions
    - Other automations in a workflow
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test and Monitor">
    Validate your implementation and monitor its performance.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/test-monitor.png" alt="Testing and Monitoring" />
    </Frame>
    
    The Activity panel provides:
    - Real-time event monitoring
    - Error detection and diagnosis
    - Performance metrics
    - Usage statistics
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deploy and Share">
    Make your solution available to users.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/deploy-share.png" alt="Deploying and Sharing" />
    </Frame>
    
    Deployment options include:
    - Direct access to workspace pages
    - Packaging as a reusable app
    - Version control for iterative development
    - Role-based access control
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Components of AI Builder

AI Builder is organized around several core concepts that work together to create powerful AI applications:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Workspaces">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/workspace-structure.png" alt="Workspace Structure" />
    </Frame>
    
    A workspace is your project environment that contains all components and manages interactions between them:
    
    - **Unique Slug**: Each workspace has a unique identifier used in URLs
    - **Event-Driven Architecture**: Components communicate through events
    - **Activity Monitoring**: Centralized logging of all events and actions
    - **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for team collaboration
    - **Versioning**: Track changes and manage versions
    
    Workspaces can be created from scratch or from templates provided through AI Governance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Blocks">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/blocks-overview.png" alt="Blocks Overview" />
    </Frame>
    
    Blocks are reusable UI components that users interact with:
    
    - **Built-in Blocks**: Ready-to-use components like chats, forms, tables
    - **Marketplace Blocks**: Additional components from installed apps
    - **Custom Blocks**: Your own blocks built using the design system
    - **Event Communication**: Blocks emit and listen for events
    - **Styling**: Customizable appearance through properties and CSS
    
    Blocks are the building blocks for creating user interfaces in pages.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Pages">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/pages-overview.png" alt="Pages Overview" />
    </Frame>
    
    Pages are assemblies of blocks that create complete user interfaces:
    
    - **Layouts**: Arrange blocks in different configurations
    - **Navigation**: Connected through links and events
    - **Access Control**: Public, private, or shared with specific users
    - **URLs**: Accessible through predictable URL patterns
    - **Responsive Design**: Adapt to different device sizes
    
    Pages use Next.js for optimal performance and SEO capabilities.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Automations">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/automations-overview.png" alt="Automations Overview" />
    </Frame>
    
    Automations are backend processes that execute business logic:
    
    - **Triggers**: Events, URLs (APIs/webhooks), or schedules
    - **Instructions**: Built-in actions, conditionals, loops
    - **Integration**: Connect to external systems and APIs
    - **Data Processing**: Transform and manipulate information
    - **Event Emission**: Trigger other automations or update UI
    
    Automations represent the server-side logic of your application.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Apps">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/apps-overview.png" alt="Apps Overview" />
    </Frame>
    
    Apps are installable packages that extend capabilities:
    
    - **Marketplace**: Browse and install pre-built apps
    - **Components**: May include blocks, automations, or both
    - **Configuration**: Some apps require setup (API keys, etc.)
    - **Documentation**: Usage instructions for implementation
    - **Versioning**: Update apps independently
    
    Apps accelerate development by providing pre-built functionality.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

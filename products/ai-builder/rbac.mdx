Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is the security model used in Prisme.ai to manage who can access, modify, and use different parts of your workspace. It ensures that users only have the permissions they need while protecting sensitive information and functionality.

## RBAC Fundamentals

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Core Concepts">
    
    The RBAC system consists of several key elements:
    
    - **Roles**: Sets of permissions that can be assigned to users
    - **Subjects**: Resources that can be acted upon (pages, files, events, etc.)
    - **Actions**: Operations that can be performed on subjects (read, create, update, etc.)
    - **Rules**: Define which roles can perform which actions on which subjects
    - **Conditions**: Optional criteria that further restrict when rules apply
    
    These components work together to create a flexible yet secure access control system.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Authorization Structure">
    RBAC configuration is defined in YAML format and consists of two main sections:
    
    ```yaml
    authorizations:
      # Define roles
      roles:
        editor: {}
        custom_role: {}
        
      # Define access rules
      rules:
        - role: editor
          action: read
          subject: pages
    ```
    
    You can access and edit this configuration through your workspace settings.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Default Roles">
    Prisme.ai includes several built-in roles:
    
    - **Owner**: Created automatically for workspace creator, has full access
    - **Editor**: Can create and modify content but limited administrative access
    - **Custom Roles**: Additional roles you define for specific needs
    
    <Info>
      The Owner role is special and cannot be modified or deleted. It is automatically assigned to workspace creators and administrators.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Managing Roles and Rules

<Steps>
  <Step title="Accessing RBAC Settings">
    To view and edit your workspace's access control configuration:
    
    1. Go to your workspace
    2. Navigate to **Settings > Advanced > Manage Roles**
    3. Edit the YAML configuration
    4. Save your changes
    
    <Warning>
      Changes to RBAC settings take effect immediately. Be careful not to lock yourself out!
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Defining Roles">
    Create custom roles to fit your organization's needs:
    
    ```yaml
    authorizations:
      roles:
        editor: {}  # Built-in role
        
        # Custom role for regular users
        user:
          auth:
            prismeai: {}  # Automatically assigned to all Prisme.ai users
            
        # Role for API access
        workspace:
          auth:
            apiKey: {}  # Can be used with API keys
    ```
    
    <Info>
      The `auth` section allows you to automatically assign roles based on authentication providers.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Creating Rules">
    Define what each role can do with specific rules:
    
    ```yaml
    rules:
      # Allow editors to read and update workspaces
      - role: editor
        action:
          - read
          - get_usage
          - aggregate_search
          - update
        subject: workspaces
        
      # Give editors full control over files
      - role: editor
        action: manage  # Shorthand for all permissions
        subject: files
    ```
    
    Each rule must include at least:
    - **action**: What can be done (a single action or list)
    - **subject**: What it can be done to (a single subject or list)
    
    Rules can optionally specify:
    - **role**: Which role this applies to (if omitted, applies to everyone)
    - **conditions**: Restrict the rule to specific cases. If omitted (or an empty object), the rule will apply to every instance of specified **subject**    
    - **inverted**: Set to `true` to make this a deny rule instead of allow
    - **reason**: Documentation string for the rule
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Adding Conditions">
    Restrict rules to specific situations with conditions:
    
    ```yaml
    # Allow access only to pages with a "public" label
    - action: read
      subject: pages
      conditions:
        labels:
          $in:
            - public
    
    # Deny editor access to API key events
    - role: editor
      inverted: true
      action: read
      subject: events
      conditions:
        type:
          $regex: ^apikeys\.*$
    ```
    
    Conditions use a [subset of MongoDB query syntax](https://casl.js.org/v4/en/guide/conditions-in-depth#supported-operators) for powerful filtering.  
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common RBAC Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Public Access">
    Control what unauthenticated users can access:
    
    ```yaml
    # Allow anyone to read pages with "public" label
    - action: read
      subject: pages
      conditions:
        labels:
          $in:
            - public
            
    # Allow anyone to create events (for automations)
    - action: create
      subject: events
      conditions:
        source.serviceTopic: topic:runtime:emit
      reason: Anyone can create any events
    ```
    
    <Info>
      Rules without a `role` specified apply to everyone, including unauthenticated users.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Role-Based Access">
    Define what each role can do:
    
    ```yaml
    # User role can read all pages
    - role: user
      action:
        - read
      subject: pages
    
    # Editor role can read and update pages
    - role: editor
      action:
        - read
        - update
      subject: pages
    ```
    
    This approach creates a clear hierarchy of access permissions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="API Key Permissions">
    Configure permissions for API access:
    
    ```yaml
    # Define workspace role for API access
    roles:
      workspace:
        auth:
          apiKey: {}
          
    # Grant specific permissions to this role
    rules:
      - role: workspace
        action:
          - read
          - manage_permissions
        subject:
          - workspaces
          - events
          - pages
          - files
    ```
    
    This allows creating an internal workspace API key with specific permissions.  
    The api key value can't be directly accessed, but instead can be injected in `fetch` instruction :  
    ```yaml
      - fetch:
          url: '...'
          prismeaiApiKey:
            name: workspace
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Automatic assignment">
    Automatically assign roles based on SSO provider & auth data :  
    
    ```yaml
    roles:
      # Assign user role to all Prisme.ai & yourOwnSso authenticated users
      user:
        auth:
          prismeai: {}
          yourOwnSso: {}
          
      # Assign admin role to users from a specific email domain
      admin:
        auth:
          prismeai:
            conditions:
              authData.email:
                $regex: ^.*@mycompany.com$
    ```
    
    This reduces manual user management by leveraging authentication information.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Securing Automations

By default, anyone can execute any automation that has an event or endpoint trigger. To restrict access to sensitive automations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Authorization Action">
    In your automation, specify an authorization requirement:
    
    ```yaml
    slug: getAnalytics
    name: "Admin Page: Init Analytics"
    description: "Restricted automation for admin use only"
    when:
      events:
        - initAnalytics
    do:
      - emit:
          event: updateAnalytics
          payload:
            data: [...]
    authorizations:
      action: admin  # This is the authorization key
    ```
    
    The `authorizations.action` field specifies a permission key for this automation.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Permission Rule">
    Define who can execute automations with this authorization key:
    
    ```yaml
    # Allow admin role to execute automations with "admin" authorization
    - role: admin
      action: execute
      subject: automations
      conditions:
        authorizations.action:
          $in:
            - admin
    ```
    
    This restricts execution only to users with the specified role.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test the Restriction">
    Verify that:
    - Users with the admin role can execute the automation
    - Users without the admin role receive an authorization error
    - The automation cannot be called indirectly by other automations without permission
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using API Keys

<Accordion title="External API Keys">
  API keys allow programmatic access to your workspace with specific permissions :  
  
  1. Use Prismeai APIs to generate an api key :  
  
  ```bash
curl --location 'https://api.studio.prisme.ai/v2/workspaces/<WORKSPACE_ID>/security/apiKeys' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <JWT>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "api key name",
    "rules": [
        {
            "action": "create",
            "subject": "files"
        },
        {
            "action": ["create", "update", "read"],
            "subject": "pages",
            "conditions": {
                "labels": {
                    "$in": ["internal"]
                }
            }
        }        
    ]
}'  
  ```
     
  2. Include the received apikey in `x-prismeai-api-key` header :  
  
  ```javascript
  fetch('https://api.studio.prisme.ai/v2/events', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'x-prismeai-api-key': 'your-api-key'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ type: 'custom-event', payload: { data: 'value' } })
  });
  ```
  
  <Warning>
    Keep API keys secure. They grant access based on their associated role without requiring user authentication.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Workspace API Keys">
  For internal API calls from automations, you can define built-in API keys:
  
  ```yaml
  roles:
    workspace:
      auth:
        apiKey: {}
        
  rules:
    - role: workspace
      action:
        - read
        - aggregate_search
      subject:
        - workspaces
        - events
  ```
  
  This creates an internal API key that automations can use:
  
  ```yaml
  - Prismeai API.searchEvents:
      query:
        type: user-login
      prismeaiApiKey:
        name: workspace
      output: events
  ```
  
  <Info>
    Workspace API keys are not visible in the UI and are specifically for internal use.
  </Info>
</Accordion>

## Example RBAC Configuration

Here's a complete example of a typical RBAC configuration:

<Accordion title="Full RBAC Example">

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Access Denied Unexpectedly">
    When users encounter permission errors they shouldn't:
    
    **Check these common issues:**
    - Verify the user has the correct role assignment
    - Look for inverted rules (deny rules) that might be applying
    - Check if conditions on rules are unintentionally restrictive
    - Ensure the rule order places more specific rules after general ones
    
    **Example fix:**
    ```yaml
    # Add a more permissive rule for this specific case
    - role: user
      action: read
      subject: pages
      conditions:
        category: reports
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Too Much Access">
    When users have permissions they shouldn't have:
    
    **Check these common issues:**
    - Look for overly broad rules without conditions
    - Check if the user has multiple roles granting cumulative permissions
    - Verify automatic role assignment isn't giving unintended access
    - Ensure public rules (no role specified) aren't too permissive
    
    **Example fix:**
    ```yaml
    # Add a specific deny rule
    - role: user
      inverted: true
      action: read
      subject: pages
      conditions:
        category: admin
        
    # Or make existing rules more specific
    - role: user
      action: read
      subject: pages
      conditions:
        category: 
          $ne: admin
    ```

Blocks are reusable UI components that serve as the building blocks for creating interactive interfaces in AI Builder. They encapsulate functionality, emit and listen for events, and can be assembled to create complete user experiences.

## Block Fundamentals

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="What are Blocks?">
    Blocks are modular UI components with specific purposes:

    - **Self-contained**: Each block encapsulates specific functionality
    - **Reusable**: Can be used across multiple pages and workspaces
    - **Configurable**: Customizable through properties and settings
    - **Interactive**: Respond to user actions and system events
    - **Event-driven**: Communicate with other components through events

    Blocks follow the [BlockProtocol.org](https://blockprotocol.org) standard, ensuring consistency and interoperability.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Block Types">
    AI Builder provides several categories of blocks:

    - **Built-in Blocks**: Core components provided by the platform
    - **Apps Store Blocks**: Components from installed Apps provided by Prisme.ai
    - **Template Blocks**: Pre-configured blocks within your workspaces for specific use cases
    - **Custom Blocks**: Your own blocks created from the design system published on the App store

    Each type serves different purposes in your application.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Block Communication">
    Blocks communicate through an event-driven model:

    - **Event Emission**: Blocks emit events when something happens
    - **Event Listening**: Blocks listen for events from other components
    - **Data Exchange**: Events carry payloads with information
    - **Asynchronous Communication**: Non-blocking interaction pattern

    This communication model enables loose coupling between components.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Common Block Properties

All blocks share a set of common properties that can be configured in YAML:

<Accordion title="Common Properties">
  <ParamField path="slug" type="string">
    Required. Unique identifier for the block in your workspace.
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField path="onInit" type="string">
    Event fired when the block is initialized. Example: `myInitBlockEvent`
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField path="updateOn" type="string">
    Event that triggers an update of the block. Example: `myUpdateBlockEvent`
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField path="automation" type="string">
    Name of the automation to associate with this block.
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField path="sectionId" type="string">
    Identifier for the section containing this block. Example: `myBlock`
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField path="className" type="string">
    CSS class name to apply to the block. Example: `block-classname`
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField path="css" type="string">
    Custom CSS for styling the block. Uses `:block` selector for the block root element.

    ```css
    :block {
      display: flex;
      max-width: 100%;
      flex: 1;
      flex-direction: column;
    }
    ```
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField path="template.if" type="string">
    Conditional display expression. Block will only be shown if the expression evaluates to true.
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField path="template.repeat" type="string">
    Allows repeating the block for each item in an array. Example: `repeat on myArray`
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField path="item" type="string">
    Variable name for the current item when using repeat. Example: `myItem`
  </ParamField>
</Accordion>

## Built-in Blocks Library

AI Builder includes a comprehensive library of built-in blocks. Here's a detailed reference for each block with its specific YAML configuration.

* [BlocksList](./blocks/BlocksList)
* [RichText](./blocks/RichText)
* [Image](./blocks/Image)
* [Button](./blocks/Button)
* [Icon](./blocks/Icon)
* [Form](./blocks/Form)
* [TabsView](./blocks/TabsView)
* [Action](./blocks/Action)
* [DataTable](./blocks/DataTable)
* [TimeList](./blocks/TimeList)

## Marketplace Blocks

The following blocks are available after installing specific apps from the marketplace.

* [Charts](./blocks-tierce/Charts)
* [Popover](./blocks-tierce/Popover)

## Block Event System

The event system is the core communication mechanism between blocks:

### Event Types

<Accordion title="Event Types">
  <ParamField path="Custom Initialization Events">
    Examples: datatable-block-init, form-block-init
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField path="Custom Update Events">
    Examples: datatable-block-update, chat-block-update
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField path="Block-Specific Events">
    Examples: form-change, block Action (emits an event with payload)
  </ParamField>
</Accordion>

### Event Communication Pattern

<Steps>
  <Step title="Event Definition">
    Blocks define the events they will emit:

    ```yaml
    - slug: Action
      text: Subscribe
      type: event
      value: user-subscribe
      payload:
        user: id
        product: productId
    ```

    This creates an event on the system when the end user interacts with blocks
  </Step>
  <Step title="Event Subscription">
    Other automations register to receive specific events:

    ```yaml
    when:
      events:
        - user-subscribe
      endpoint: false
    
    ```

    This tells the automation to listen for the specified event and call the appropriate handler when it occurs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Block Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Block Composition">
    Blocks can be composed from other blocks to create higher-level components:

    - **Container Blocks**: Wrap and organize other blocks
    - **Composite Blocks**: Combine multiple blocks into a cohesive component
    - **Layout Blocks**: Control the arrangement of nested blocks
    - **Wrapper Blocks**: Add functionality to existing blocks

    Composition enables reuse and maintains separation of concerns.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Block Styling">
    Blocks can be styled through multiple approaches:

    - **CSS Editor**: Direct CSS customization
    - **Built-in CSS**: Keeping the default CSS
    - **CSS Classes**: Predefined style sets

    Consistent styling ensures a cohesive user experience.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Block Conditions">
    Blocks can have conditional behavior based on various logical factors:

    - Block Display Condition (if): Example: if MyCondition
    - Repeat Block on Array: Example: repeat on MyTable
    - Variable Name for Each Item: Example: MyVariable

    Conditions enable dynamic, responsive interfaces.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

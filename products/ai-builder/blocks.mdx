Blocks are reusable UI components that serve as the building blocks for creating interactive interfaces in AI Builder. They encapsulate functionality, emit and listen for events, and can be assembled to create complete user experiences.

## Block Fundamentals

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="What are Blocks?">
    Blocks are modular UI components with specific purposes:

    - **Self-contained**: Each block encapsulates specific functionality
    - **Reusable**: Can be used across multiple pages and workspaces
    - **Configurable**: Customizable through properties and settings
    - **Interactive**: Respond to user actions and system events
    - **Event-driven**: Communicate with other components through events

    Blocks follow the [BlockProtocol.org](https://blockprotocol.org) standard, ensuring consistency and interoperability.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Block Types">
    AI Builder provides several categories of blocks:

    - **Built-in Blocks**: Core components provided by the platform
    - **Apps Store Blocks**: Components from installed Apps provided by Prisme.ai
    - **Template Blocks**: Pre-configured blocks within your workspaces for specific use cases
    - **Custom Blocks**: Your own blocks created from the design system published on the App store

    Each type serves different purposes in your application.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Block Communication">
    Blocks communicate through an event-driven model:

    - **Event Emission**: Blocks emit events when something happens
    - **Event Listening**: Blocks listen for events from other components
    - **Data Exchange**: Events carry payloads with information
    - **Asynchronous Communication**: Non-blocking interaction pattern

    This communication model enables loose coupling between components.

## Common Block Properties

All blocks share a set of common properties that can be configured in YAML:


  <ParamField path="slug" type="string">
    Required. Unique identifier for the block in your workspace.

    ```yaml
    # Page/Block
    - slug: RichText
      content: Hello world
    ```
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField path="onInit" type="string">
    Event fired when the block is initialized. Example: `myInitBlockEvent`

    ```yaml
    # Page/Block
    - slug: RichText
      onInit: init my content
    ```

    ```yaml
    # Automation
    when:
      events:
        - init my content
    ```
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField path="updateOn" type="string">
    Event that triggers an update of the block. Example: `myUpdateBlockEvent`

    ```yaml
    # Page/Block
    - slug: RichText
      onInit: init my content
      updateOn: update my content
      content: '{{text}}
    ```

    ```yaml
    # Automation
    when:
      events:
        - init my content
    do:
      - emit:
          event: update my content
          payload:
            text: Hello world
    ```
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField path="automation" type="string">
    Init the block with an automation as endpoint. Example: `myAutomation`

    The difference with the event base init is that the automation will take query string in `{{body}}`
    and the output will be used to upgrade the block. No need to emit an update event and to listen to
    a `updateOn` event.

    ```yaml
    # Page/Block
    - slug: RichText
      automation: init my content
      content: '{{text}}
    ```

    ```yaml
    # Automation
    slug: init my content
    output:
      text: Hello world
    ```
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField path="className" type="string">
    CSS class name to apply to the block. Example: `block-classname`
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField path="css" type="string">
    Custom CSS for styling the block.
    
    There is some private keywords to help you target your element:

    `:block` is a shortcut to the unique generated class of your block. Use it to target the root of your block DOM.  
    Every selector you set will be automatically prexifed by `:block` to avoid polluting the page styles.

    You will need to use :block specifically if you set a dynamic stated class on your block:

    ```yaml
    - slug: RichText
      content: Hello world
      className: 'status-{{item.status}}'
      css: |-
        :block {
          background: white;
        }
        :block.status-closed {
          background: red;
        }
    ```

    When you set css, it override the default styles of the block. But maybe you
    just want to keep the styles but add only something. You will use `@import default`:

    ```yaml
    - slug: TabsView
      css: |-
        @import default;
        
        .pr-block-tabs-view__tab {
          background: red;
        }
    ```

    Finally, you may want to set styles on an element external to your block.
    You can target outside it by using `:root`:

    ```yaml
    - slug: RichText
      css: |-
        :root a {
          color: red; // All links in the page will be red.
        }
    ```
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField path="template.if" type="string">
    Conditional display expression. Block will only be shown if the expression evaluates to true.

    ```yaml
    - slug: RichText
      template.if: '{{textIsVisible}}'
    ```
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField path="template.repeat" type="string">
    Allows repeating the block for each item in an array.

    ```yaml
    - slug: RichText
      template.repeat:
        on: '{{items}}'
        as: item
      blocks:
        - slug: RichText
          content: '{{item.text}}'
    ```
  </ParamField>

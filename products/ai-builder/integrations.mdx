    async function integrateWithSpecializedService(data, apiKey) {
      try {
        // Prepare the data according to the service's requirements
        const transformedData = transformForService(data);
        
        // Make the API request with proper authentication
        const response = await fetch('https://api.specialized-service.com/endpoint', {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
            'X-Custom-Header': 'Value'

## Integration Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication Issues">

    Common authentication problems and solutions:

    - **Invalid Credentials**: Verify API keys, tokens, and usernames/passwords
    - **Expired Tokens**: Implement token refresh logic
    - **Missing Scopes**: Ensure OAuth scopes include required permissions
    - **Certificate Issues**: Check SSL/TLS certificate validity
    - **Clock Skew**: Synchronize system times for timestamp-based auth

    Debugging approach:

    1. Check logs for specific authentication errors
    2. Verify credentials in workspace secrets
    3. Test authentication in a standalone tool (e.g., Postman)
    4. Review token lifecycle and expiration
    5. Check for recent API or authentication changes
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connection Problems">

    Resolving connection issues:

    - **Timeouts**: Adjust timeout settings or optimize performance

    1. Check network connectivity from your environment
    2. Verify endpoint URLs and port numbers
    3. Test with simpler requests to isolate issues
    4. Implement proper connection handling with retries
    5. Use monitoring tools to track connection patterns
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Data Format Issues">

    Solving data formatting problems:

    - **Schema Mismatches**: Align data structures between systems
    - **Encoding Issues**: Ensure proper character encoding (UTF-8)
    - **Type Conversions**: Handle data type differences appropriately
    - **Missing Fields**: Add required fields or provide defaults
    - **Format Validation**: Validate data meets receiving system requirements

    Debugging approach:

    1. Log actual data being sent and received
    2. Compare with API documentation requirements
    3. Implement data validation before sending
    4. Use transformation steps to correct format issues
    5. Test with sample data that is known to work
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Performance Issues">

    Addressing integration performance problems:

    - **Rate Issues**: Handle high-volume webhook scenarios

    Debugging approach:

    1. Enable webhook logging on both sides
    2. Verify webhook URLs are correct and accessible
    3. Check authentication and signature validation
    4. Test with simplified payloads
    5. Monitor webhook delivery attempts and failures
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Using the Activity Log">

    Leveraging the Activity log for integration diagnostics:

    - **Event Filtering**: Focus on relevant integration events
    - **Payload Inspection**: View actual data sent and received
    - **Error Analysis**: Identify specific error conditions
    - **Timeline Correlation**: Connect related events
    - **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring issues

    Debugging approach:

    1. Filter Activity log to relevant time period and event types
    2. Examine event sequences leading to failures
    3. Look for patterns in successful vs. failed interactions
    4. Analyze error details and contextual information
    5. Use real-time monitoring for immediate issue detection

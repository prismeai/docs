Deploying AI Builder use cases requires a structured approach to move your solutions from development to production. This guide outlines strategies for versioning, deploying, and managing applications across different environments to ensure reliability and performance.

## Deployment Strategies

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Single Workspace">
    
    **Best for:** Basic applications with minimal complexity, such as simple prompting agents
    
    In this approach, you use a single workspace for both development and production:
    
    - **Development:** Create and test your application directly in the workspace
    - **Production:** Once tested, the same workspace serves as the production environment
    - **Version Control:** Use versioning to save stable points for potential rollback
    
    **Advantages:**
    - Simplest deployment approach
    - No need to migrate between workspaces
    - Quick iteration and updates
    
    **Considerations:**
    - Limited separation between development and production
    - Higher risk of disruptive changes affecting live users
    - Best suited for applications with low complexity and minimal regulatory constraints
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Multi-Workspace">
    
    **Best for:** Moderately complex applications with some regulatory needs
    
    In this approach, you use multiple workspaces on the same Prisme.ai instance:
    
    - **Development Workspace:** For building and testing
    - **Production Workspace:** For live user access
    - **Optional Pre-Production Workspace:** For final testing before deployment
    
    **Advantages:**
    - Clear separation between development and production
    - Same instance simplifies resource management
    - Different access controls for each environment
    
    **Considerations:**
    - Requires process for migrating between workspaces
    - All environments share the same Prisme.ai instance resources
    - Good balance of separation and simplicity
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Multi-Instance">
    
    **Best for:** Complex enterprise applications with strict regulatory requirements
    
    In this approach, you use separate Prisme.ai instances for each environment:
    
    - **Development Instance:** For building and initial testing
    - **Staging/Pre-production Instance:** For integration testing and validation
    - **Production Instance:** For live user access
    
    **Advantages:**
    - Complete isolation between environments
    - Independent scaling and resource allocation
    - Highest level of security and stability
    
    **Considerations:**
    - Most complex to manage
    - Requires robust deployment processes
    - Necessary for applications with strict compliance requirements
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Versioning Your Application

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Git Repository">
    Set up version control for your workspace:
    
    
    1. Access workspace raw configuration by clicking "Edit source code" in the workspace action menu
    2. Add repository configuration to the end of the file:
    
    ```yaml
    repositories:
      github:
        name: My GitHub Repository
        type: git
        mode: read-write
        config:
          url: https://github.com/YourUser/your-repository.git
          branch: main
          auth:
            user: 'your git user'
            password: 'your git password'
    ```
    
    <Info>
      You can use secrets for sensitive information:
      ```yaml
      auth:
        password: '{{secret.gitPassword}}'
      ```
    </Info>
    
    <Info>
      For SSH authentication, use:
      ```yaml
      auth:
        sshkey: |-
          YOUR SSH
          KEY
          HERE
      ```
      Remember to use `git@github.com:YourUser/your-repository.git` format for SSH URLs.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Push to Repository">
    Save your workspace state:

    
    1. From the workspace action menu, select "Versions"
    2. Choose the repository you configured
    3. Click "Push to repository"
    4. Enter a commit message describing your changes
    5. Submit to save the current state
    
    This creates a snapshot of your workspace in the remote repository.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pull from Repository">
    Retrieve saved workspace state:
    
    1. From the workspace action menu, select "Versions"
    2. Choose the repository you want to pull from
    3. Click "Pull from repository"
    4. Confirm the operation
    
    This updates your workspace with the state stored in the repository.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Exclude Files from Import">
    Protect specific configurations during pulls:
    
    ```yaml
    repositories:
      github:
        name: My GitHub Repository
        type: git
        mode: read-write
        config:
          url: https://github.com/YourUser/your-repository.git
          branch: main
          auth:
            user: 'your git user'
            password: 'your git password'
        pull:
          exclude:
            - path: 'index' # Preserve workspace config
            - path: 'security' # Preserve security settings
            - path: 'pages/custom' # Preserve specific page
    ```
    
    This prevents overwriting custom configurations when pulling changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deployment Methods

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Built-in Deployment">
    Use Prisme.ai's built-in tools to deploy between workspaces:
    
    **Export/Import Method:**
    1. In the source workspace, go to the action menu and select "Export"
    2. Download the workspace archive
    3. In the target workspace, go to the action menu and select "Import"
    4. Upload the workspace archive
    5. Review and confirm changes
    
    **Direct Push/Pull Method:**
    1. Configure the same Git repository in both source and target workspaces
    2. Push from the source workspace
    3. Pull into the target workspace
    
    Built-in deployment provides a straightforward approach without requiring external tools.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="CI/CD Integration">
    
    Integrate with DevSecOps pipelines for automated deployment:
    
    **Setup Steps:**
    1. Configure Git repositories for your workspaces
    2. Create CI/CD pipeline in your preferred system (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.)
    3. Set up pipeline stages for testing, validation, and deployment
    4. Configure deployment scripts using Prisme.ai API
    5. Implement approval gates for production deployments
    
    **Pipeline Example:**
    ```yaml
    # Example GitHub Actions workflow
    name: Deploy Workspace
    
    on:
      push:
        branches: [ main ]
    
    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2
          
          - name: Validate configuration
            run: ./validate-config.sh
            
          - name: Deploy to staging
            run: ./deploy.sh staging
            
          - name: Run tests
            run: ./run-tests.sh
            
          - name: Deploy to production
            if: success()
            run: ./deploy.sh production
    ```
    
    CI/CD integration provides automated, consistent deployments with added security and validation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="API-Based Deployment">

    
    Create custom deployment processes using the Prisme.ai API:
    
    **Key API Endpoints:**
    - `GET /workspaces/{id}/export` - Export workspace
    - `POST /workspaces/{id}/import` - Import workspace
    - `POST /workspaces/{id}/push` - Push to repository
    - `POST /workspaces/{id}/pull` - Pull from repository
    
    **Example Script:**
    ```javascript
    // Example Node.js deployment script
    const axios = require('axios');
    
    async function deployWorkspace(sourceId, targetId, apiKey) {
      // Export source workspace
      const exportResponse = await axios.get(`https://api.studio.prisme.ai/v2/workspaces/${sourceId}/export`, {
        headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` },
        responseType: 'arraybuffer'
      });
      
      // Import to target workspace
      await axios.post(`https://api.studio.prisme.ai/v2/workspaces/${targetId}/import`, 
        exportResponse.data,
        { 
          headers: { 
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
            'Content-Type': 'application/octet-stream'
          }
        }
      );
      
      console.log('Deployment completed successfully');
    }
    
    deployWorkspace('source-workspace-id', 'target-workspace-id', 'your-api-key');
    ```
    
    API-based deployment provides the most flexibility for custom deployment workflows.

## Understanding What's Versioned

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Included in Versioning" icon="check-circle">
    <p>Workspace components that are saved and deployed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pages and their configurations</li>
      <li>Blocks and custom components</li>
      <li>Automations and workflows</li>
      <li>Security roles and permissions</li>
      <li>App configurations</li>
      <li>Workspace settings</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Not Included in Versioning" icon="circle-xmark">
    <p>Data that remains specific to each environment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Events and their history</li>
      <li>Collection data</li>
      <li>Crawled documents</li>
      <li>Uploaded files</li>

      <li>Runtime state</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  The versioned content is identical to what's included in the workspace export archive.
</Info>

## Environment-Specific Configuration

Manage differences between environments:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use Workspace Secrets">
    Store environment-specific values as secrets:
    
    ```yaml
    # In development workspace
    secrets:
      apiEndpoint: https://dev-api.example.com
      maxRequests: 10
    
    # In production workspace
    secrets:
      apiEndpoint: https://api.example.com
      maxRequests: 100
    ```
    
    Access these values in your application using:
    ```
    {{secret.apiEndpoint}}
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Conditional Logic">
    Implement environment-aware behavior in automations:
    
    ```yaml
    # Example automation with environment detection
    slug: processData
    do:
      - conditions: 
        "{{environment}} == 'production'":
          - callAPI:
              url: "{{secret.productionApi}}"
        default:
          - callAPI:
              url: "{{secret.developmentApi}}"
    ```
    
    This allows your applications to adapt to different environments.
  </Step>
  
</Steps>

## Handling Pull Results

After each import or repository pull, Prisme.ai emits a `workspaces.imported` event with details:

```json
{
 "files": [
  "index",
  "security",
  "pages/test.yml",
   ...
 ],
 "deleted": [
  "automations/removedAutomation.yml"
 ],
 "version": {
  "name": "latest",
  "repository": {
   "id": "yourRepositoryId"
  }
 },
 "errors": [
  {
   "msg": "Could not rename workspace slug from {oldSlug} to {newSlug} as it is already used by workspaceId zlkpbRF",
   "err": "SlugAlreadyInUse",
   "conflictingWorkspaceId": "..."
  }
 ]
}
```

You can create automations that listen for this event to:
- Log deployment activities
- Notify team members of successful deployments
- Track errors and conflicts
- Trigger post-deployment tasks

## Troubleshooting Deployments

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Import/Pull Failures">
    Common causes and solutions for import problems:
    
    **Issue: Slug Conflicts**
    ```
    "Could not rename workspace slug from {oldSlug} to {newSlug} as it is already used"
    ```
    **Solution:** Ensure unique slugs across workspaces or exclude index file from import.
    
    **Issue: Missing Dependencies**
    ```
    "Cannot find referenced component {componentId}"
    ```
    **Solution:** Ensure all dependencies are included in the import or available in the target workspace.
    
    **Issue: Permission Errors**
    ```
    "User does not have permission to update {resource}"
    ```
    **Solution:** Verify user has appropriate permissions in the target workspace.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Post-Deployment Issues">
    Troubleshooting problems after deployment:
    
    **Issue: Integration Failures**
    
    **Causes:**
    - Different service endpoints in the new environment
    - Missing or invalid credentials
    - Network access restrictions
    
    **Solution:** Update environment-specific configurations and verify connectivity.
    
    **Issue: Performance Problems**
    
    **Causes:**
    - Different resource allocations between environments
    - Increased load in production
    - Data volume differences
    
    **Solution:** Monitor performance metrics and adjust resource allocations as needed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rollback Procedures">
    How to revert to a previous state:
    
    **Git-Based Rollback:**
    1. Identify the stable version tag or commit
    2. Pull that specific version into your workspace:
    ```yaml
    repositories:
      github:
        config:
          branch: main
          tag: v1.0.0  # Or specific commit hash
    ```
    
    **Export/Import Rollback:**
    1. Maintain archives of known-good workspace states
    2. Import the last stable archive if issues occur
    
    **Best Practice:** Test rollback procedures regularly to ensure they work when needed.

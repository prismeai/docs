## Getting Started with Users & Permissions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Users & Permissions">
    Navigate to the Users & Permissions section in the AI Governance dashboard.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Manage users">
    View and manage all platform users from the Users tab.
    
    
    Use search and filters to locate specific users based on criteria like name, email, or status.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure roles">
    Create and manage roles with specific permission sets in the Roles tab.
    
    Define granular permissions for each role based on organizational needs.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Organize groups">
    Create and manage user groups in the Groups tab.

    Add users to appropriate groups based on their department, function, or access needs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## User Management Scenarios

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="New Employee Onboarding">
    When onboarding a new employee:
    
    1. Validate User Account (by default "pending" )
    2. Assign appropriate roles based on job function
    
    This structured approach ensures new employees receive appropriate access from day one.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Role Changes">
    When an employee changes roles:
    
    1. Review current permissions and access
    2. Remove unnecessary access from previous role
    3. Assign new permissions based on new responsibilities
    4. Update group memberships
    5. Document changes for audit purposes
    
    This process maintains the principle of least privilege during transitions.
  </Tab>
  
  
  <Tab title="Employee Offboarding">
    When offboarding an employee:
    
    1. Initiate account deactivation process
    2. Remove all role assignments
    3. Remove from all groups
    4. Archive user account and access history
    5. Generate offboarding report for compliance
    
    This comprehensive process ensures complete access removal.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Custom group and users from authData

Two automations exist to set custom group or role if they are set. These are configured by default to not be overwritten on import or update of the products.

<tabs>
  <Tab title="Custom platform role">
    The automation `getUserCustomPlatformRole` can be edited to output a role and a fallback role, if it does not exists in the AI Governance product.

    Here is an example:
    
    ```yaml
    slug: getUserCustomPlatformRole
name: /Permissions/Roles/Get Custom User Platform Role
do:
  - set:
      name: ssoGroupMapping
      value:
        ROLE_USER: User
        ROLE_KNOWLEDGE_USER: KnowledgeUser
        ROLE_KNOWLEDGE_ADMIN: KnowledgeAdmin
        ROLE_BUILDER: Builder
        ROLE_COLLECTION: Collection
        ROLE_PLATFORM_ADMIN: PlatformAdmin
  - set:
      name: userCarmGroup
      value: '{{user.authData.userCustomRole}}'
  - set:
      name: updatedRoles
      value:
        role: '{{carmGroupMapping[{{userCarmGroup}}]}}'
        fallback: User
output: '{{updatedRoles}}'
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Custom groups">
    The automation `getUserCustomGroup` can be edited to output an array of group, or one group. This will override the user current group.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
